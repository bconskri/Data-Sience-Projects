The Harpers magazine article you list and also called well written contains the phrase """"Post American"""" in the sub-title and article content, an obvious bias. Time is no exception to bias. Every city demolishes structures, so its not notable. One of the authors you list, for example, has controversies cited on Wikipedia for 'misreporting', hardly a good source.  The stacking of sources with the slant indicated shows merely they are not neutral and contain much bias. They amount to WP:Fancruft and WP:Coatrack.  Wikipedia is not obligated to include editorial bias. Detroit takes in plenty, its $1.1 billion budget with higher population density and higher spending per person than Atlanta show for example that weasel words like 'decline' and others inserted are inappropriate. An emergency manager is in place to alleviate largess caused in part by public sector union contracts - it shows responsible action by the governor. The comprehensive study shows the city of Detroit is in good shape and the Detroit Free Press reported it. The city of Detroit's home owner vacancy rate is 2.9%, in line with the national average.  The Detroit Free Press termed it a major population shift which is accurate. Many cities experienced change with suburbanization and freeways. The region is more populous and probably more prosperous than the 1950s. The city has seen multi $ billions in revitalization and it continues, the city serves an entertainment hub, has state of the art facilities, state of the art schools, a major university, casino resorts, a world class corporate center, a wealth of very well kept historic and national landmarks and restorations,  modern freeways, etc., is a partner on regional boards which did not exist in the past.

 Mel Gibson image, again 

Hi! I was wondering if you had read my comments about getting Clare to transfer copyright to you. I think this could be done verbally.

 Israeli art students 

Thanks, Umeboshi! Yes, it has surprised me how quick on the draw (and vituperative) some folks have been in expunging any reference to the alleged/purported/apparent Israeli espionage. As happens in other contexts, I think some people conflate criticism of Israel with anti-semitism  or conflate this intentionally. The ironic thing is that if all this stuff is true (as seems at least worth serious consideration), it even reflects well on Israel, as there is evidence Israel warned the US that something big was coming. All countries spy; to me, that's not such a big deal. I just want to know about it in this particular case, and feel annoyed when any discussion is stifled """"with extreme prejudice.""""

Here's the simple steps to get K delivered to your home:

1) Setup a hushmail.com email address
2) Contact globalpharmonline@hushmail.com and let him know what you want.  Here's the K they have along with prices. Make sure you tell him you want the brand Indus. The other brand they have sucks.

Ketamine 5000mg bottle $180.00
Ketamine500mg Inj 10ml Rotex Germany$25.00
Ketamine250mg Inj 5ml Indus $15.00
Ketamine 50mg Inj 2ml Indus $5.00

The 5000mg bottle = 10 (10ml) viles.  That breaks out to 5 grams powder. One 10ml vile breaks out into half a gram of powder.

It's real easy to get the liquid into powder if you don't know how to do it.  Just put it on a plate and boil water underneath it until it evaporates, then you'll be left with the powder.  You can also put the liquid on pyrex in the oven.  Be careful not to heat the liquid anymore than once it's gone otherwise you'll burn your shit.

 Do not add troublesome content to any article, such as: copyrighted text, libel, advertising or promotional messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Deliberately adding such content or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered vandalism, doing so will result your account or IP being blocked from editing.

 The official language box can only have Malay because Malay is the only official language. Unlike India, South Africa, or Canada or Singapore of which their constitutions say there are more than one official language, Malaysian constitution explicitly says only Malay is the official language. Thus - only Malay in the official language box. Wikipedia's job is to spread information, not make new information. See WP:NOR.

 Wapipedia 

Anyone here use it (http://wapipedia.org)? I'm kind of new to it, and there doesn't seem to be a talk/editing facility. So I'm going to post this here, hope that's okay. Their article on the Prophet Mohammed includes the following text:

By his own standards, the continuing traditions of social justice in the Islamic World, of methods and knowledge of science, history and medicine as they evolved in the modern world (thanks to his profound influence driving Muslims to literacy and inquiry), and the prayers of over one billion Muslims, many of whom pray for him five times a day (or attach """" peace be upon him"""" after each mention of his name), render Muhammad arguably the most influential man in all history, an honour often reserved for Jesus in the West. Even those historians who have deplored his influence and considered it to have retarded the growth of its chief rival faith, Christianity, express grudging admiration for the man.

and this:

To the traitors inside Medina it must have come as a surprise when the 10,000-strong force of Abu Sufyan failed to cross a trench dug around Medina by order of Muhammad, as the Persian scribe Salman e-Farsi had suggested to him. After the retreat of Abu Sufyan and his forces, the Muslims directed their attention towards the groups that had committed treason to the Charter of Medina. The munafiqun quickly crumbled, and their leader Abd Allah ibn Ubayy pledged allegiance to Muhammad. The Muslims then besieged the Banu Qurayza, who had intrigued against them. They had the opportunity of choosing Muhammad as an arbitrator, but instead the Banu Qurayza chose Saad ibn Muadh, the leader of their former allies, the Aus.

And this is its take on the Battle of Badr, 624 CE, which is markedly different to that found in the Wikipedia article (which raises doubts about the aftermath of the battle): 

On March 15, 624 near a place called Badr, the two forces clashed. Though outnumbered 800 to 300 in the battle, the Muslims met with success, killing at least 45 Makkans, including Abu Jahl, and taking 70 prisoners; whereas only 14 Muslims died. To the Muslims this appeared as a divine vindication of Muhammad's prophethood, and he and all the Muslims rejoiced greatly. Following this victory, assassinations eliminated Medinans who had satirized Muhammad, and the victors expelled a hostile Jewish clan. Virtually all the remaining Medinans converted and Muhammad became de facto ruler of the city.

I made that guess based on everything that's happened so far in Naruto, and the way Kishimoto creates plot twists of this kind. Now your comment is what seems fanboyish and unjustifiable. Kabuto already seemed to have a kind of kind of second nature back during the first part of the series where his eyes would change color when he got mad. Kishimoto wouldn't give him a similar state to Juugo, because it wouldn't be something that new and because he wouldn't want to have two characters be so similar. And as for my Orochimaru possesing Itachi theory, just because something happens at one point doesn't mean it will be the same story next time. By your logic, just because Kakashi needed the help of his students (look 2-3 people right there!) to bail him out of Zabuza's trap during their first meeting, that would mean Zazbuza could have easily killed him during their second meeting when they were fighting alone. Or just because even Gaara's own father, the Kazekage himself, feared Gaara's power, a genin like Naruto shouldn't have been able to beat him let alone after he transformed. Or how could the Uchiha, being the strongest clan of Konoha, be killed so easily by a single member of their village? See? You definetly chose the wrong story to bring up that kind of logic. Practically every single fight in Naruto craps all over it. Orochimaru COULD take over Kabuto, and go on to Itachi after Sasuke's team has weakened him. Perhaps they cause him to overuse his Sharingan eyes, who knows? Orochimaru could find him, make his move, steal his body, and seek vengeance on Sasuke. The point is just that neither of us knows whats gonna happen and we'll just have to read the story.",0

In addition, my edit has been reverted several times for no apparent legitimate reason!

 Please delete user/disc pages; warn jayron/redpen/mufka 
Hello stephen,
If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.

I requested speedy deletion on 1Apr for reason 1.6. jayron deleted it, then acted  as if s/he did me a favour. I feel jayron shouldnt have been the one to delete it initially as s/he  and I have negatively interacted in the past. Followups from jayron included an unneccesary block; followed by telling me to get a yahoo email so that I may contact wiki admins! 

Wiki is all about anon editing  as such I didnt and wont get an email account in order to communicate as it is not required.

Since then jayron,redpen, mufka have been repeatedly editing my page. I blank my page they restore it. This has been happening since April, so for 3months now.  I bet if I changed their pages they'd posting threats of  """"i'll report you"""" and/or """"you will be banned"""". It is quite easy for me to get a new ip address but I dont think Ive done anything wrong, so  I wont change my ip address. 

If my pages needed to be restored /reverted, I definitely think those three arent the ones who should do it as they/I have  a convoluted history.

If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.
If you could contact jayron, redpen, & mufka & ask that any problems they have they let an admin or arbitrator know, instread of making changes or posting to me.

This article's lead statement is that BizTalk Server is an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).  In fact, BizTalk Server has always been positioned as an Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) server.  ESB is a layer on top of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Microsoft provides these capabilities in BizTalk Server as a collection of components and documents in the """"ESB Toolkit"""".

 Wikipedia is not a dictionary.

I'm struggling to see what the current dispute is about after my enforced spell in the slammer.  Karbinski argues for """"Philosophy is the science that studies the fundamental aspects of the nature of existence in order to provide man with a comprehensive view of life. Major branches of Philosophy include Metaphysics, Epistemology, Ethics, Politics, and Aesthetics. The word philosophy is of Ancient Greek origin: φιλοσοφία (philosophía), meaning """"love of knowledge"""", """"love of wisdom""""""""

I prefer a return to the main four branches.  Deleting the 'reasoned argument' part is not supported by the sources, of which there are plenty.  Philosophy would be a science in the original meaning of 'science' (scientia) but the modern meaning, while not entirely different, has connotations that it would be best to avoid.  On whether the philosophy of language belongs in the main branches, that is debateable.  My view, given the dominance of the 'Old Logic' (the Categories and On Interpretation) and of the importance of those two to the Metaphysics, I would say it does belong.    """,0

'Fraid not. This used to happen a while back; either pages for both British English and American English would exist, or more often editors would fight to move a page from one to the other. In June 2005, the Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee ruled that """"when either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change. For example, with respect to British spelling as opposed to American spelling, it would only be acceptable to change from American spelling to British spelling if the article concerned a British topic."""" So since an enterprising Brit got there first, American English words like millimeter and liter redirect to the British English equivalent, but the opposite is true for colour or carburettor.

In the case of geologic map, an American was the first to create the article, so you have to edit that page. However, here's a few suggestions of what you can do:
The text in bold in the opening line should reflect the title of the article. Therefore, since geological map redirects to the page, you can change the first sentence to read """"A geologic map or geological map is a special-purpose map made to show subsurface geological features.""""
If there's a difference between U.S. and U.K. maps, I'd split the two into separate sections after the opening paragraph, and detail the differences for each (re-ordering the page as I'd done with this edit). If there's no difference, I'd just remove the specific references to the United States as being unnecessary, and expand on what's there.
You can also provide links to British geological maps if such a resource exists, as has already been done for USGS maps.

An explanation of the style ruling can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Disputes over style issues and Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English, or if you're really bored you can read the original case at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk, which concerned and edit war over the use of BC or BCE for Biblical dates.

WP:PRIMARY sources such as press releases, band websites, or the like do not count towards notability. Also, be wary of blog sources, as most blogs do not count towards notability.

My people are not """"Iranians"""" and the Kurdish language is one language. I find it amusing at how bias you are. You ignored all the links that I showed you by saying it did not meet Wikiepdia guidlines, which is crap in the first place. You then managed to find only very few that disagreed with me.

Harry Potter has been extremely well received but there is an odd emphasis on negative criticism rather than positive criticism in the reception section.

In fact, if the series wasn't well known then it would be assumed from reading this page that the books were poorly received and little appreciated and that's not the case.

Why are the sources so selective? Even generally positive reviews have only had negative comments quoted from them, leading to the impression that the series was critically panned. This section doesn't indicate almost any positive reviews about the books and places too much focus on negativity.

My view on this is probably similar (but probably not identical) to Cirt's. Speaking for myself, I have two problems with the use of """"Calvinist"""" on this basis: (i) there are multiple ways that calling a website 'The Calvinist Corner'  the most obvious is that Slick is writing from a Calvinist perspective. Another might be that he is writing about Calvinism. To take the former as true, and draw the the conclusion that Slick is a Calvinist is an inference and thus WP:Synthesis. It's most probably true, but not the sort of thing we're meant to be doing on Wikipedia. (ii) There's a fairly strong Calvinist thread through much (most?) of conservative evangelical Christianity. There are probably dozens of articles where we could find a similar level of evidence for applying the word 'Calvinist'. We don't, and to my mind shouldn't, unless a WP:SECONDARY source feels it sufficiently relevant/important a description to make use of it. This means that such articles aren't 'loaded up' with true-but-of-doubtful-relevance WP:IINFO descriptions. I suspect that part of the problem is that much of the secondary-source writing concentrates on CARM rather than Slick personally. However this simply means that, per WP:DUE, we should follow suit.

I think Mark Williamson known also as """"Node ue"""" is having difficulties  with the words out of his mouth!

Nevertheless the authority of Node_ue is very good presented by himself in [] 

Just take a look the way the Kid Mark looks himself: (Warning! May be in various ways interpreted!) 

Mark is an all-powerful entity made of pure energy. If you know him, you will be blessed and your dreams will come true (or at least they might).

Strengths: All powerful, handsome, smart.

Weaknesses: NONE!!! THE GREAT MARK HAS NO WEAKNESSES! HE IS ALL-POWERFUL!

Special Skills: All-powerfulness, intelligence, &c.;

Weapons: All-powerfulness... sharp teeth... hrm...

All-powerfulness: YES! THE GREAT ENTITY KNOWN AS """"MARK"""" IS ALL-POWERFUL!!! YES!

Node's origin as a faggot (gay)…

[] (where he admits he is a faggot)

""""I've also noticed a few things that are possible hints at his thinking he's homosexual/bisexual but not wanting to admit it to himself:
He lies quite a bit to make himself look more """"masculine"""" (apparently he's the most popular guy in school with the girls, and he has to run quickly if he wants to get away from them), he is always going on about how much more attractive he is than me (according to him, this is because both of his parents are of 100% Jewish ancestry, while I only have 3/8ths [3/4ths of the people on my mother's side]), he goes out of his way to make extremely offensive jokes about homo/bisexuality, he goes out of his way to make it look like he's a homophobe, and at the mention of anything even remotely related to homosexuality he has so much disgust for it that he must show that you could fill a whole encyclopedia with his """"ewws"""" (not really meant seriously, according to him).""""

Of particular importance is the following passage:

Vertebrobasilar Stroke Study Findings
There was an association between chiropractic services and subsequent vertebrobasilar artery stroke in persons under 45 years of age, but a similar association was also observed among patients receiving general practitioner services. This is likely explained by patients with vertebrobasilar artery dissection-related neck pain or headache seeking care before having their stroke.

Hence, there is no difference in association between stroke and DC and MD visits.  This suggests that VB strokes are not necessarily caused by SMT or a visit to the DC but that they are already in progress prior to the visit.  It should also be noted that there are 2 MDs involved in this study in case the argument of bias comes up.

This really says a lot of the extent of authority as Mr. Irving enjoyed (then). He is still widely believed to be one of the greatest authorities on WW2 and of the nature of the Nazi regime. All this still stands, as everyone can witness for himself by reading some of his books, which are available free of charge from his website as Downloads.

However ONE chapter of the aforementioned book was about the holocaust. And because of that David got subjected to a smearing campaign hitherto unseen in scope. Booksellers was pressured not to sell his books (no mention of this on Wikipedia) - that is why he gives them away for free. Whereever he goes in the world he find arrangements cancelled ib short notice, the hotelliers or universities being pressed to pull the event.

I find David irving to be a good and honourable englishman. His father was naval officer who took part in The Battle of Jutland. You cannot find ANY factual fault in his work. If you can David is the first who wants to know - email him.

By the way, he do not deny the holocaust, which is why your Wikipedia entry is so wrong. He find the whole subject boring, but hardpresset he will tell you that it should be spelled with a small h as there were many holocausts, poles,russians,gypsies and others got killed. Civilians allways get caught out in war, but it is undeniable that the Nazi regime was especially brutal.

 To be a folk without a homeland living among a majority is allways a precaurious situation to be in in times of unrest, or so history has proven many times.

David akcnowledges that many jews got killed, but he happen to hold the view that most died from mal-nutrition and diseases, and that aplyes to ALL inmates in concentrationcamps. So you see he is not denying .",0

When comparisons of heart rate and life expectancy are adjusted for body weight in mammals, it appears that life span is pre-determined by the basic energetics of living cells. This inverse relationship between heart rate and life expectancy reflects an epiphenomenon in which heart rate is a marker for, or a determinant of, metabolic rate and energetic needs.

The metabolic rate is dependent on the physical activity, which in turn is related to, and likely determined by, heart rate itself. Regression analysis on a logarithmic scale between body mass and metabolic rate among animals yields a straight line with the same slope as that between body mass and heart rate.19 Therefore, there is a close link between temperature, metabolism, and heart rate, and the question is which is the primary control among these parameters? If heart rate determines the metabolic rate, it follows that a relationship between heart rate and life span exists in the entire animal kingdom including man.",0

Pm_shef mentioned the Susan Kadis article that he wanted to research for; but though the 10 hour time expired, there are still no such edits. I'm sure it doesn't mean that he isn't taking this process seriously. 

So Pm_shef and Leotardo, and myself, we have 10 hours before all the editing noted above will totally cease. Pm_shef is to add his objective Kadis research, and Leotardo will have his two edits added, before the 10 hours expires. I will go and do that now.

55668,"List of Mad Magazine issues 

Hi . Thanks for your recent improvement to this article. Collectonian's point is surely that keeping a list article with the combined tables of contents of all the issues is an honor that we accord to very few magazines. I personally believe that it's justified in the case of Mad, because famous publications deserve more coverage than obscure ones. Irrespective of Collectonian's particular viewpoint, a high-quality list article with lots of references is easier to defend against future requests for its deletion. I haven't studied this one enough to know how it could be improved, but I think your new intro is a step in the right direction. I hope to post again on the Talk but haven't had the time yet. 

You are one the of the people who I was hoping to get the attention of, because I think only someone familiar with the magazine would have good ideas for how to improve this article.  I read the magazine when I was a kid, but have no idea of how to explain its cultural significance. 

I notice that Mad (magazine) is also tagged for needing inline citations, and I sympathize with that tag. We need to get the help of some Mad aficionados who are willing to dig up references.",0

That doesn't mean that there wasn't a baseball team that won the """"World Series"""" in 2008 in the United States.  Again, see the difference?  When you rephrase things (especially things involving phrases translated between dissimilar languages), things get confused.  The current handbook contains an abundance of detail about the All Asia Championship.  Partially summarizing the situation to a news reporter and then having her ask an expert three questions based on her minimal understanding of the situation while constructing a story explicitly hostile to Oom Yung Doe (which was what I meant by """"hostile"""", obviously) is not a good way to seek the truth.

As I said, I'm not arguing that this should simply not be presented; it is close enough to an informed, expert opinion that I can't really ask for it to be ignored except in the face of contradictory evidence.

When someone (like User:Crossmr or User:Scobell302) uses a threat of authoritarian action to prove that they are right, it does dishonor to this equality.  If you want to prove you are right, use the rights of all wikipedians (like User:Michaelas10 and User:Richard Harvey): EDIT!

Hell, when someone like User:74.129.234.170 tells you you're an asshole for being an asshole (or, in the words of a more tactful wikipedian, """"too bold""""), am I contributing to wikipedia?  No, probably not.  But am I honoring the spirit of equality?  Hell yeah!  We can swear at eachother until the cows come home without one of us depriving the other of the powers inherent in a wiki.  But if I wanted to contribute to an encyclopedia run by a community of rule-obsessed elites, I would submit to Encyclopedia Britannica.

Or, look at it from the utilitarian perspective.  I once tried to get in a revert war, and I found it was way too boring after only two rounds, so I quit (allowing User:Crossmr to get the last word...until a third party emerged from the community of equals to take my place).  But, man, throwing sand in the face of a pointless authoritarian?  Priceless!  I'll do it forever if you're willing to keep playing.  Bring it on!

Suffice it to say, I have a wikipedia alter ego, which has a couple serious contributions under his belt.  Or, to put it another way, I have a lot of IP addresses.

Convince, threaten, block.  Don't threaten, threaten, threaten.  It just doesn't work.

So if you want to revert my work, go for it.  I might argue with you, I might even be uncivil, but you can be certain that I won't block you or delete your contributions or even vandalize your encyclopedic content.  You won't find any proudly-displayed thank you notes from administrators on User_talk:74.129.234.170.

 Unneccessary reference 
Is Samurai Champloo important enough to be included in this article? It doesn't seem to add much to the article. Why's every article I look at have some reference to anime?

Why does every other article I read have reference to some American Sitcom or other live-action medium? It's a part of popular culture, that's why. The Sunflower Samurai as well as Sunflowers themselves are a HUGE central plot point that dominates almost every single episode.

So post it in the Samurai Champloo article. Anime is not central nor even moderately relevant to actual sunflowers.

If it is at the end, labeled, and sufficiently known information, why not have it?  

 why do sunflowers """"want"""" to follow the sun? 

what do they get out of it? is this known? guessed by relevant public work? I myself would even take a clue, here. (thats I really wanna get info on this) Bye and thanks.  

Heliotropic flowers are more prevalent among plants in alpine areas. The absorbed light makes the flowers warmer, which attracts more pollinating insects. http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1998.00336.x?cookieSet=1   May be the sunflower's heliotropism is a rudimentary feature from an alpine past?  

 Pizarro? 

It says that he cultivated them around 1000 B.C.... but this is impossible because Pizarro didn't even go to the Americas until the 16th century A.D.

However I'd like to point out that there has been a major conference earlier this year in February (with 38 scientists presenting the results of their researches) [The Present-Day Habitability of Mars 2013 - Program]

You can watch the video presentations and decide for yourself if the current prevailing scientific opinion is that the surface of Mars is potentially habitable or uninhabitable. It is true that before the Phoenix lander possible salty brine observations in 2008 the prevailing view was that life on the surface of Mars is impossible. But that is no longer the consensus and it would be hard to find a single researcher in the field who holds that opinion today. I have put a copy of the section into my user space as I frequently use it for reference and found it a useful resource. Please note I did not write this section myself, only added a couple of sentences to it.

Authority of authors   
Prefer authors with an established reputation in the field where Wikipedia uses them for reference. 

Mark Twain is a satirist and a writer of fiction, not a respected demographer.

These references are also in breech of 

Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence

Claims not supported or claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community. Be particularly careful when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them. 

There is no conspiracy to silence these claims.  This account is problematic because Twain's work seems to indicate that the 350,000 people do not exist in Twain's time, or that there are much less people than 350,000 living in Palestine.  Verified and peer-reviewed sources indicate that there were 350,000 people in the area concomitant to Twain's visit.  Thats what needs to be said in a section on demographics, not the musings of a satirist and fiction author.

Self-published sources

Main article: Wikipedia:VerifiabilityA self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites, and books published by vanity presses. Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources.Exceptions to this may be when a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise Twain's work is also in breech of this portion of WP:RS as well.  His accounts cannot be considered verified or subject to any form of independent fact-checking.  He is also not a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise.

If we were doing original research or if we did not have good population estimates, then this information would be valuable. Since There are no accurate estimates of population at the time so laregely scholars can relate to the observations of travelers at the time'' is clearly wrong and we do have accurate estimates of population at the time, it is clear that we need to use these and expunge the article of all non-scholarly sources, including the Herbert Samuel link I contributed earler.",0

JayW - Predators do not scrutinize the internet in the hopes of tracking some kid who foolishly posted their name to Wikipedia. It simply doesn't happen. It doesn't happy here, nor does it happen anywhere else; and I would be happy to concede to anyone who proves otherwise, though I very much doubt that will happen. I whole-heartedly believe the situation this policy is designed to protect against is a terrible myth which, by distracting money, time and effort from actual issues, facilitates the sexual abuse of children.

On the other hand, some predators do use the chat services to anonymously groom children. This situation, while I doubt it would happen in such an incovenient environment, might deserve a policy.

..so, does this policy solve anything, as it stands? No - it doesn't prevent children from stating their age. Instead, it focuses on irrelevant information, like their street address and real name, which the predator can acquire privately once he has located the child's online contact information. Since many people use the same username across all the interwebs, this probably wouldn't be difficult.

The only solution, so far as I can see, is to police kids who mention their age. Any other policy is, to say the least, completely useless. Out,

 Pre Christmas Review 

Hi Spinning, 
I'm doing a quick review on your edits right now... One of the things that you need to remember is our primary purpose here is to build the encyclopedia.  Coaching is secondary as is working towards adminship.  I noticed that you've read a few of my recent essays on CSD, I know this because you've made edits to my essay on why I hate speedy deleters.  I appreciate the edits.  Another essay that I would suggest you take a look at is my essay on my coaching philosophy and what it means to be work with an adminly spirit.  One of the key things that I look at isn't """"Does the candidate have the right edit counts in various places"""" or """"Does the candidate know policy backwards and forwards, but rather do they have the spirit of an admin.""""  Do people respect the candidate and do they act as in a manner that instills confidence and respect from the community.  Do they embody what I think an admin encapsulates?  To me being an admin isn't about the buttons, one can (and should) be an admin before they ever submit themself to the community!

That being said, I encourage you to look at this edit.  I like the fact that you use your user space to keep notes and work on articles.  This shows a sign of somebody who has been burnt by CSD'ers ;-)  No, in reality, I think developing ideas and concepts in the user space should be encourage.  Is  a list of things that you'd like to work on?  If so, what have you succeeded in acomplishing in the past?  Eg, what isn't there that might have been there 2 months ago?

Read my essay (found on my user page) about my coaching philosophy.  There are four key areas that I like to see from candidates.-'''' PoppaBalloon'' """,0

 Myself and the Sante Kimes Wikipedia article 

I would like to set some things straight about myself and the Sante Kimes article.

1. I am NOT Sante Kimes.

2. I am NOT a relative of Sante Kimes.
3. I DO NOT HAVE or EVER HAD an attorney contacting Wikipedia. This is on outrageous claim.

I AM a researcher of well-known court cases, and have researched the Sante Kimes case in the past.

SUBJECT BAN
 1. Since an administrator asked me to voluntarily not edit anything on the Sante Kimes article, I have complied.

2. If those interesting in my edits to the Sante Kimes article, please just see the article's edit history.
Since making editing mistakes on my FIRST-EVER edits on Wikipedia, I have complied with the appropriate editing guidelines.
Namely,
Posting in the discussion page of the article about ANY large edits I felt appropriate for the article.
 Placing details and reason for the edit in editing tags.

Please see the article's editing history to see that the only edits I have made were to correct dates, spelling mistakes, adding verifying tags, and making small corrections to the article that were needed. Furthermore I gave full details for the changes I made in the editing notes Please see the article's editing history to confirm this.

3. The only edit that I made that was in debate was the article's 'lead' info.
I do contend that the current 'lead' starting with """"American felon"""" was placed there as an action of spite by that editor.

The 'lead' I placed WAS of a neutral POV, factual WITH EXACT dates for the named convictions and was supported by references. 
The current 'lead' does not state the dates for when these conviction took place. 
Furthermore, I had placed """"American woman"""" in the 'lead', which IS in the 'lead' of various other female criminal's articles who (arguable) allegedly committed WORSE crimes than Sante Kimes is accused of committing.
If it's appropriate for those articles, why is it not appropriate for this article?

In closing, I DID follow editing guidelines for the Sante Kimes article after I learned what was acceptable editing.
Furthermore, I discussed - at length - in the article's discussion page about changes that I felt WERE needed. Yet I NEVER took it upon myself to edit those issues until an agreement could be reached. 

I would like to point out that those changes have yet been agreed upon and I HAVE NOT made any edit in regard to those issues. Therefore, that demonstrates that I am following the editing guidelines.

Because of an apparent personal problem an administrator has with me. - Which is the same editor I was in dispute with on this article's discussion page They have asked me to voluntarily not edit the article - or, most outrageously, not EVEN post on the article's discussion page to discuss the issues with this article.(How is this not considered conflict of interest??)  
I have complied with that request, even though I have not yet read or been advised as to what guideline I was in violation of in regard to the Sante Kimes article or it's discussion page.""",0

 Personally speaking (of course) I think the British should just give up the ghost, get over their loss of empire, and start living side-by-side with the Irish without feeling the need for such jingoistic terms like """"British Isles"""". After Germany and France, Ireland remains Britain's third largest market in absolute terms, a quite surprising reality which is often overlooked (http://www.eiu.com/index.asp?layout=ib3Article&article;_id=114081196&pubtypeid;=1122462497&country;_id=1460000146&category;_id=775133077&rf;=0).

Thanks Vassyana, I hope that you will help us to reach the long-elusive consensus.

I suspect that in the end we may need to seek external help to decide whether some details are to be included. But if we have a process which can lead to a decision, that's a definite improvement.

For one, Sub-Zero seems to have been chosen as Batman's face-off, according to the game art and trailer.Video interviw with Ed Boon, Gamespot Ed Boon has said that some of the characters' abilities, especially on the DC side, have been toned down to make them balanced within the game.

Assume Good Faith Does Not Mean Have Blind Faith Despite the Facts

By repeatedly  for months  citing a book published by St. Martin's Press (New York), """"Feeling Your Pain,"""" as a source of chapter-long damning criticism of the National Civilian Community Corps, LoverOfArt was abusing the name of a respected publishing house and misleading Wikipedia readers.

That St. Martin's Press would publish a book does not of course imply that no competing or contradictory facts exist.  But it does imply that the information has survived a responsible vetting process by fact checkers and lawyers.

(By the way, according to the flap copy of the book,""""Feeling Your Pain,"""" (at least as published in hardcover by St. Martin's Press, 2000), the writing of the author, Bovard, """"has been denounced by FBI Director Louis Freeh, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the White House AIDS czar, as well as by the Chiefs of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. International Trade Commission."""")

As is now clear, """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not even mention NCCC or the National Civilian Community Corps (except in the footnotes, referring to one speech by then-President Clinton  not exactly a source of documented criticism of a program he signed into law), in a chapter devoted to what was then 50,000 members of AmeriCorps, not the 1100+ Corps Members of NCCC.

So to Dbiel and Che Nuevara: It took a lot to get me to sound off about LoverOfArt. I responded calmly to his repeated rants about me, saying I was foaming at the mouth, my writing was Lunacy, fluff, and similar crap.  At this point his """"editing"""" of the National Civilian Community Corps has been conclusively demonstrated as biased and maliciously distorted:  his doctoring of quotes into misleading criticisms of the National Civilian Community Corps (quoting NCCC as having been labeled a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites that does not mention NCCC) should disqualify him from being part of this group.

When I read what he wrote and posted at Wikipedia, quoting the author of Feeling Your Pain as calling NCCC a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites (untrue), saying the author devoted an entire chapter of his book to criticism of NCCC (untrue)  in a book published by St. Martin's Press, even I started to doubt the litany of glowing reports from credible and verifiable sources that I had read about this organization.

Someone unfamiliar with positive reports about NCCC would have been even more likely to greet news of the demise of NCCC - something ardently sought recently by persons using the same kinds of arguments LoverofArt posted  with detachment, if not pleasure.

That his statements  quotes  about NCCC are now known to be false and misleading means that he no longer enjoys an assumption of Good Faith.

So I would like you to spare me your lectures about my supposed sins. """"No information is better than misleading information,"""" as Jimbo Wales liked to say. LoverOfArt has no business mauling the content of this page, nor does Wikipedia have any business disseminating his posts.

I am perfectly ready and willing to work respectfully and cooperatively with any editor who has not used the vicious and underhanded methods that LoverofArt has resorted to.

I have shown a willingness to respond to your editorial concerns. Dbiel wanted more notable sources. I posted a number of them quickly, including citations from the Baltimore Sun, the NY TImes, The Washington Times, and an Arizona newspaper - news outlets reflecting a spectrum of points of view.  (LoverofArt discounted all of the Baltimore Sun citations, saying none were notable.)

I don't maintain that my copy (or my view of what should be at the NCCC page) is perfect or unassailable or that other's work has no place. I have labeled some posts """"suggested edits.""""  I have no problem with honest content that is in context that runs counter to my perspective.

But LoverofArt is clearly willing to resort to dishonest (or at the very least, grossly misleading) editing to ensure that his view prevails.  My editing reflects my perspective, but it  is not dishonest:  I present information that is verifiable and accurate, to the best of my ability.  If I make a mistake, and I sometimes do, I try to correct it, and I would welcome the correction of others - I do not want to be have a part in disseminating inaccurate or misleading information.  

I left LoverofArt's Criticisms page on the NCCC article for a long time, until I could verify whether or not it was accurate.  That is the mark of responsible editing.

Dbiel, I respect your knowledge of the Wikipedia way of doing",0

 I just wanted to say . . . 

that you were a horrid admin and really mean person. You lacked focus, commitment and neutrality. I'm jolly glad you're semi-retired and I'll dance the day you're de-sysopped. But, in a spirit of fairness, it'll be a dance of your choice.   

I've seen your dancing, it's crap. Why make a sad day even sadder? My only consolation is that you'll likely get blocked before Jennavecia gets desysopped. She's one of the few administrators I think wikipedia would actually miss.  Fatuorum 

I was actually a really good admin. And I may have my mean moments... I don't know who you are, but I get the impression that you're an idiot, so I suppose that's your justification for calling me mean. I was not required to be focused here, to say I lacked commitment is just stupid as hell, and neutrality... well, I suppose it depended on the situation. I couldn't care less if you're jolly, but you can save the dancing for the day I retire, which may be today, and I recommend holding your breath until I'm desysoped... since it won't happen. I've never abused my tools, nor would I. Not to mention, it's practically impossible to desysop an admin here. I do plan to resign though, so you can dance for that too. But just know this... As I walk away from this place, you can kiss the view. vecia 

I just wanted to say that Jennavecia is the most awesome person in the world, and anyone that says otherwise has their cranium up their anus.  We love you Jennavecia!  <3 .talk.contribs 

Hang on, let's not go overboard here. She did pretty well as an admin, but that's hardly a qualification for sanctification.

Speedy deletion of Feague
 A tag has been placed on Feague requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Graphologists claim to be able to determine personality traits based on an examination of your handwriting. I personally have as much faith in this as I do the astrological forecasts in the newspaper...in other words, not much.

But I still read my horoscope occasionally. Why? Because it's fun! So if you want to have a graphologist examine your handwriting, go ahead. Enjoy yourself.

Godwin devised his Law (and others built on it) with reference to discussions such as the one on this Talk page. Its antecedents lie in Reductio ad Hitlerum, also called argumentum ad Hitlerum, or reductio (or argumentum) ad Nazium – dog Latin for """"reduction (or argument) to Adolf Hitler (or the Nazis)"""" – a modern informal fallacy in logic. It is a variety of both questionable cause and association fallacy. The phrase reductio ad Hitlerum was coined by an academic ethicist, Leo Strauss, in 1953. Engaging in this fallacy is sometimes known as playing the Nazi card. Doing so (that is, playing the Nazi card) destroys one's credibility, which is why you have been patiently advised not to do it. If indeed Patiwat initiated the article on Banjerd Singkaneti, note that he also included the protest of The Embassy of Israel as published in the Bangkok Post. That protest, strictly my POV of course, demolishes Banjerd's credibility. Notice, however, that that is MY POV; others, who prefer not to be confused by facts, would believe that it is the Israelis' credibility that has been demolished. As for your credibility, write now I think you incredibly angry, which is not a bad thing to be, if only you learn to focus it properly. If you do learn to focus properly, then you will find that you and Patiwat are allies opposed to the policies of PAD as practiced in present-day Thailand, without reference to what went wrong in the middle of the last century in the middle of Europe.

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't Hüttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died?

Cab Rider Vignette
On coming to Westport once by train , there were few cabs around 
and I shared a cab ride with Sandy Dennis, the cab dropping her off 
at her home first. (And continuing on to my inlaws in Westport.)

She was at the time in some broadway play ....

And in a continuing romantic lilt over several years, I sent to the theatre not once, but 5-6 times dozens of roses signed simply """"cab rider"""" - as I liked her right away. 

She never knew who the cab rider was.

Zhongnanhai / """"China White House""""
The location of the headquarters offices of the Communist Party is to the West of the Southwest corner of the forbidden city. Here is that info from Google.com 

Zhongnanhai 
The Zhongnanhai is a complex of buildings in Beijing, China adjacent to the Forbidden City which serves as the central headquarters for the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China. The term Zhongnanhai is synonymous with the leadership and government administration of the nation, and is often used as a metonym for the Chinese leadership at large (in the same sense that the term White House frequently refers to the President of the United States and his associates). Chinese Presidents, including Hu Jintao, and other top PRC leadership figures carry out many of their day-to-day administrative activities inside the compound, such as meetings with foreign dignitaries. However, the complex is shrouded in some mystery as it is closed to the general public, with photography additionally being strictly curtailed at several prominent locations such as the main gate. However, China Central Television frequently shows footage of meetings inside the compound, but limits its coverage largely to views of the interior of buildings.

not realizing its significance and needed inclusion...

52054,"And now for some... amusement 

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

 Vandalism by 99.44.204.232. Please stop it  

Would 99.44.204.232 stop vandalising this article.  People have invested a lot of time and effort to improve this article  it doesn't help if you keep vandalising it.  In future if you have something positive to add to this article please discuss it in the talk page.  I have to spend hours undoing what you have just done.  Citing several sources (some of which are unreliable) about one particular issue which has already been addressed and sourced with notable sources is one thing, deleting edits with notable sources and then copying and pasting those sources to make a point is another.  You wanted the article to talk about Serer Nile Valley migration.  That had already been discussed several times with notable sources like Gravrand, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.  You also wanted the ethnonym of Serer to reflect the thesis of Diop.  The article already did that with notable sources including Diop himself.  If only you took the time to read the whole article you would have realised that, all these had been addressed. However, you should also appreciate that not every scholar and certainly not the ultra traditionalist Serer who wants nothing to do with Egypt agree with Diop and in fact his thesis were rebutted by several scholars including Schuh, etc.  These are relevant view points which should also be taken into account in other to avoid bias.  

I will now respond to the """"sources"""" that you have provided.

Link 1: 
http://books.google.com/books?id=EZLF3T-5tlgC&pg;=PA706&lpg;=PA706&dq;=serer+wolof+north+east+africa&source;=bl&ots;=6ZlcoUiSsf&sig;=zOFR1CQY5BWf2thxHjWIhmq9Q8Y&hl;=en&ei;=BMFiToPpH6HL0QGE142OCg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6&ved;=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;&f;=false

Have you realised that this source is not credible contrary to all the sources cited? Have you also realised that the author referred to the Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum as Wolof states?  Even the least verse on Senegambian history can easily find out for themselves that the Kingdom of Sine and Kingdom of Saloum were Serer Kingdoms not Wolof never mind a supposed scholar.   
Further, all the sources, historical and archaeological evidence shows that the Senegambian stone circles were built by the Serer people. (See: Gravrand, Pangool; Gamble, Salmon and Njie; Burke and Else; and F. Richard).

Since they were built by the Serers, and evidence have shown that they are built well before the 14th century, how then could the Serers have migrated into the area into the 14th century?  That doesn’t make sense.  Now the Serers may have migrated to from the Nile Valley as implied by Henri Gravrand in “La Civilisation Sereer, Pangool”, which is one of the sources cited in the article,  but as noted by Gravrand, if they did came from the Nile it was more than 5 thousand years ago and certainly not the 14th century. Further, as demonstrated by Gamble, Salmon and Njie, the Serer are the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia, others later moved in.  This backs up archealogical source, backs up Gravrand, Kleine, Richard  and so on.  
If your source was referring to the Guelwars of Kaabu coming from Kaabu to Sine in the 14th century at least I could understand that because it was at that time the Battle of Turubang (1335) occurred as stated by Sarr, Becker and others.  Even the Wolofs were already present long before the 14th century never mind the Serer people who have been present for thousand of years. Further as substantiated in the article with credible sources which all backs up each other, the Almoravid wars on Takrur due to religion (Islam) led to the Serers of Takrur who were finally defeated in Battle to leave Takrur and headed south.  That was in the 11th century during Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar and War Jabi.  Even those “Takrurien” Serers came south long before the 14th century to join their other Serer relatives (See Daggs).

This link tells us about the meaning of Serer according to Pierret, which tallies with Diop.  The article had already address this point with notable sources as evident in the article.  However, since there are controversies regarding the meaning of the word, it is relevant to address those as well.  Furthermo",0

 Bot automation at Wikipedia:Today's articles for improvement 

Over the past two weeks, there has been extensive discussion on introducing bot automation to assist with maintenance of the Today's Articles for Improvement project. A  has now been approved for trial and will carry out the weekly duties. The bots first run will occur around ' (midnight on Sunday).If you have been assisting any of the weekly maintenance tasks, please refrain from doing so this week. The bot needs to be tested and proven it can do the job, and it only gets one chance per week. The tasks will include:
 Adding the new scheduled article to Wikipedia talk:Today's articles for improvement and removing the entry from Wikipedia:Articles for improvement
 Set up the schedule pages for the new TAFI, except the adding of an image and caption
 Adding  to the new article for improvement, remove  from last week's article and add  to the talk page
 Notify relevant WikiProjects that the new TAFI is within their scope
 Send a mass message to everyone on the notification list of the new TAFI selection

Updating the accomplishments and archiving selections is still done manually, along with daily' tasks such as adding approved entries to the articles for improvement page. These will become automated in the near future.

We hope the bot proves to serve well, and by carrying out the routine housekeeping tasks we can boost the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the project.  thanks you for your service in helping with the weekly tasks in the past, and for your cooperation during this trial period )

If any1 wishes to discuss the issue in detail, please contact me for an explanation. With regard to """"Shuttegod"""" I am in militant disagreement that the previous text he mangled & reduced in his arrogant edit was """"wordy"""" or """"awkward"""", it was a tight, concise very well written opening to the article explaining in essence what the Anglosphere is. What he reduced it to with his edit - with its bombastic egotistical patronising editing note - was weakly written, mushy, vague & illogical at points. Sorry if that's a bit tuff, but it's the truth. The Anglosphere is an increasingly important concept geo-strategically & it's important to get this source for the term right for those who search via Google for an explanation of it. I am open to edits, but they need to augment & improve the opening text, not reduce & state things that are not true, such as """"Eire being a part of the Anglosphere"""" - any1 with the slightest comprehension of the history of Ireland since 1916 can see the fallacy of this view, & whomever holds it does not grasp even the basics of what the Anglosphere actually is!

Plantdrew - Yr edit of the arms programme that militarily links the Anglosphere was useful & interesting, & I left it at 1st, even tho it didn't quite belong in the opening preamble of the article as it was a little too micro & not macro enough for an opening principle description, the reason I edited it out in my scrapping of """"Shuttegod's"""" massacring of the text is that it seemed to be antagonizing him, & it was out of place a little in the opening.

The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, """"independecne"""" and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under """"deliberate discrimination"""". There are massive blackouts every day, and the only people who are well off are the Marxist puppets who are the ANC, the druglords, and people who install security systems.

You've made three mistakes:
 
Is the version I'd reverted to - unstable? On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable?
Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it?
The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page.

Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I """"continue to revert"""", also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you """"continue to revert"""".
If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus.
Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

57945,"What an irony? The very policies that are used to protect articles on Wikipedia are been exploited by some editors and nobody at Wikipedia can do anything. Nobody has any rights to stop editors who go on a rampage over an article just because of some pov of theirs, using the very policies of Wikipedia used to protect articles. I guess there is no system of checking the edits of such editors against vandalisation such that they can blatantly claim that whatever you report to authorities nobody is going to listen. This is not according to Wikipedia standards and also not healthy with respect to protection of articles on Wikipedia. 

Protection should be such that deletion and blanking should not be allowed to editors other than the author of the article or administrators. This would curtail vandalism to a great extend. It will also stop vulturism in editing wherein editors who do not contribute with any articles but just pick on other editor's articles for whatever reasons would be discouraged and genuine critics would be encouraged who will follow the procedure of mentioning on talk pages for editing.

Furthermore if there are issues it can be discussed in talk pages and updation made accordingly. 

If any author does not log in for specific period of time the article may be alloted to another editor or taken up by adminstrator or it can be locked and put up as library content which can be edited by any administrator. 

This would add international standards as one expects on Wikipedia and also encourge authors to provide more contribution.

Anyway still it is a huge effort by Wikipedia to maintain such a huge collection of articles, it does not matter if a few articles get deleted or vandalised or removed from Wikipedia just because some pov of some editors.

His music has been released onto iTunes and Lander-Boyce now sells CDs, so I have no idea why this article was chosen. I also worked very hard on it to show Lander-Boyce's biorgaphy and discography. Why? Why? Why?

I'm sure you don't want an 8-page report on the differences between the various groups, so I created a diagram for your convenience. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, I think it shows what I could scratch the surface with in about 10,000 words. Adding citations might bring it up to 12,000, but the ratios involved will always be subjective. I will never be able to get a million Jews to sign a statement that they are against Zionism, for instance, but based on the people I've talked to, I think that about 35% to 40% are. That percentage could be off, but I personally have talked to many people of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds, from all around the world, who think that the methods of the Zionists are despicable, and who will not fight with the Zionists when the end comes and the sides are chosen.

If you believe President Bush when he says, """"If you are not with us, you are against us,"""" then it looks like the sides have already been chosen. I don't think there's very many people with the side of the Crusaders and Zionists. If the only other position is against the Crusaders and Zionists, then I feel comfortable with the numbers of my side during the upcoming apocolypse.

I started this article because someone in al-Qaeda asserted that al-Qaeda is the same as the Front. It isn't, so I changed the al-Qaeda article to more accurately describe it as a subset of the Front. After that, people wanted to know what the Front was, so I started this article. I didn't put the original reference to the Front in the al-Qaeda article; I merely clarified it. There are a lot of groups in Islam that don't like the United States or Israel. I realize that its easier to combine many of these groups into a general idea when talking about them, but thinking of the larger International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders, which is really more of a movement, as the same thing as al Qaeda, is perhaps too much of a generalization. You could generalize the World Islamic Front as loose enough to be the same thing as the International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders except that the World Islamic Front only has Islamic members. That means that most of the people in Bush's """"against us"""" category could not be part of the World Islamic Front.

Your assertion that """"bin Laden certainly would have no part of such a front as you describe,"""" is absolutely untrue. bin Laden isn't a racist. He encourages any group that helps his cause and has often appealed to American and Jews to control the crimes being committed in their names by their leaders.  """,0

 Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city 

Dear Salvio and other administrators:

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

 Including an article on Wikipedia 

Re:  In order for an article to be included on Wikipedia, there must be reliable published third-party sources that focus on that topic. Without such sources, a neutral, verifiable, encyclopedic article on that topic cannot be made, so the article is, sooner or later, deleted. Articles on topics that are not independently notable are often merged into related articles, such as an article on the band. Also, note that titles like """"(musician)"""" are not added to an article unless there are multiple topics with the very same name, such as multiple articles with the same name """"Michael Madden"""".

 Death details? 

While no date is mentioned in this article, it is stated in Horik I that Ragnar dies mysteriously in 845. In the article on one of his sons, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, it recounts the story of Ragnar's death by King Ælla, in a pit of snakes, in 865. I wouldn't be surprised if there were more conflicting details in other related articles. Is there a definitive source for this? (or is the problem that of conflicting sources?)

All artists had cited sources refering to there signed status on The Black Wall Street Records, I suggest you revert this edit yourself as you have deleted the information for the reason """"artists with no body of work"""". There are related pages for one artist, and the other two are to be made. But since the cited sources are evident pages are not neccesary for the input of those characters as they fall into the category The Black Wall Street Records.

 Spam hunter! 

Hi A.B.  Thanks for all the reports and for all the work you do on finding new spammed domains.  I am impressed by your last report on WT:WPSPAM.

I have a question and a suggestion, though.  The question: when you report, could you for IPs that spam wikipedia include the range where that IP is in (preferably the CIDR).  That makes it easier to blacklist IPs on COIBot (not that it is a trouble for me to find them).  The suggestion, you might be interested in the IRC channels Link additions on en.wikipedia and edits on small wikipedia.  The former runs a linkwatcher, shadowbot, COIBot etc.  On the latter normally also a linkwatcher is active (but it is down at the moment), as are some other watching bots (also COIBot is there).  We also have some other nifty tools (though again, one that you might be very interested in is also down at the moment).  If you'd like to speak to us, we talk in the talk channel (we also command the bots there).

 Neutrality? 

""""There are also allegations that the attention and sympathy especially from the Australian public and media may be related to xenophobic sentiment and a unfair mistrust of Asian legal systems. Also, many think there was no motive for Corby to transport marijuana from Brisbane to Bali where the value is far less, and where it is readily available on the street not far from her prison (and even within it), i.e. it would be like smuggling ice to Eskimos.""""

This seems POV to me.  (Of course, in the interests of full disclosure I believe that she is guilty).

I added some referencing to a Sydney Morning Herald article where it was alleged that Australian marijuana (in particular hydroponically grown marijuana) sold quite well in Bali for a few reasons:
 Indonesian marijuana is quite poor in quality - rich tourists generally prefer the Australian stuff.
 Due to the lack of entrapment laws in Indonesia, tourists can often be caught by Balinese police stings - and so prefer to buy their marijuana off other whites, who are less likely to be members of the Indonesian police.

I can understand the text on the (turns out to be non-lethal) white powder being sent to the embassy being removed.  I believe that even though a link hasn't been established between the two events that this incident will have a bearing on the case, and especially its portrayal (spelling?) in Indonesia, but I can see why the lack of a clear connection between the two events has led to its removal.

That said, I cannot understand why the text on """"smuggling ice to Eskimos"""" is allowed to remain whereas the text from the Sydney Morning Herald, a respected (within Australia at least) news source is not.  If the view that there would be no point smuggling marijuana to Indonesia is allowed to remain, why not the view that there would be a point, especially if that view is put forward by a major Australian newspaper?  The article seems POV and biased in favour of Corby to me.

Thank you  """"If a country's position on the matter receives significant coverage in high-quality secondary sourcing (mainstream media and scholarly works), it is worth inclusion"""". It's basically the standard for WP:WEIGHT I've been proposing for a while now (except that I offered to adhere to a more strict """"two reliable sources"""" rule). I note that what Langus points out is also of relevance to establish the importance of such a section being present in the article.
@Irondome: the source you presented is a good one to give an idea of the weight assigned to the international position on the issue, it doesn't mean we should base the entire section on that article or only articles from that source (in fact: we should not, the more articles from reliable sources the better). The problem with attempting to come up with a summary like you propose is that it would be very difficult to come to an agreement. In this case, short mentions of individual (or grouped, as to avoid listing) positions could prove to be less prone to attract never-ending discussions.
This is what I suggest (all in one single section with separated paragraphs):

 International position (title)
 Opening paragraph about the disparity in pro-Argentinian and pro-British positions being voiced (properly sourced and neutral)
 UN resolutions (briefly, mainly: """"The UN does not recognize the islanders as having a right to self-determination hence Britain continually rejects the repeated UN's calls for resolving the issue through dialog with Argentina"""")
 Mention of the US and EU neutral positions (the """"Monroe Doctrine"""" should be moved to another part of the article as to not extend the US position too much) as major international players. The fact that the islands are listed as a British OCT by the EU and the Commonwealth should be mentioned too.
 Mention of the majority of Latin American states backing Argentina (as per article presented by Irondome, the article presented by me and this article accessible here, section 3.1). China should be added here too being another major international player.
 Finally Spain's position should be mentioned and also its similar issue with Gibraltar (although editors have previously opposed any mention of Gibraltar here, I still think it is worth of mentioning)

That's my proposal and I am of course open to hear comments and/or corrections. It should end up being quite shorter than the current section and easier to source too. Regards.   """,0

1. I do not want to hide Darwin, but give him is place where he belongs, as a historical figure and definition. 2. What I have seen in the old talk before I arrived, and during the time that I have been here, is that all specialists try it work on this and leave disillustioned.  
  
  . I agree with Slrubenstein above. I have long argued that my position, Endler's position (position 1 high up in this discussion page) is a current scientific one and very closely linked with Darwin's.
Excatly, it is A current one. Not THE current one. making that THE definition is WP:NOR.  
  
It confuses because the old definitions are incorrect.  
Kim, I do not see how you can say this unless you agree with Henry Ford that """"history is bunk.""""  Most people are interested in history, and there are even scientists who are interested in the history of their science.  That it confuses you does not mean (as I think is now evident) that it will confuse most readers of this encyclopedia.  They understand that things change.  They also understand that trends have beginnings.  It is simply meaningless to say """"the old definition is incorrect.""""  If you do not understand why, I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science - definitions are more or less useful.  It was that old definition that led to a line of inquiry that has led evolutionary scientists to more precise and more useful understandings of the process.  If anything, as educators we should show readers how scientists start with one formulation of natural selection and then refine it.  
You know, the fact that you reject Darwin's definition of natural selection does not mean natural selection and the theory of evolution are wrong.  On the contrary, it simply means that science has a history, that scientists debate and refine concepts which necessarily change over time.  Do you think this is a trivial point?  In the United States, at least, you are dead wrong.  If you are not from the US let me tell you, there is a huge """"creationist"""" movement which has, on numerous ocassions, had the theory of evolution banned from high schools.  And you should know that one """"argument"""" they make is that Darwin was - well, as you say, """"incorrect.""""  """"See!"""" they exclaim, """"even scientists say Darwin was wrong!  We should no longer teach evolution!""""  Obviously, they misunderstand the way science works.  They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them.  I think scientists have an obligation to educate people about this.  Showing how scientists accept an idea, and then change its definition or conceptualization by refining it without repudiating it is the best way to accomplish this.    |  Talk 
You confuse hiding Darwin versus focusses on current usage first and add darwin's definitions in the history section.  
Okay, but with all due respect, you confuse starting with Darwin for focussing on Darwin.  They aren't the same.  There are two reasons for starting with Darwin: one, it is a reasonable starting point, two, whatever differences there are between you, Axel, Marco and others, or among different scientists who have published on natural selection, all can agree that Darwin introduced the idea.  Why not just say @@@Natural selection''', as first introduced by Darwin, refered to ....  Since Darwin, evolutionary scientists have revised his definition based on new findings in genetics and molecular biology...?    |  Talk

Even so, though, it's not like Rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time. In other words, it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements, some of which led to temporary schisms, but to my understanding Justinian's system, even if not everybody liked it, became a practical reality (one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed Rome further and further away).",0

He is showing signs of dislike for a particular race, otherwise one will not try deliberately attempt to tarnish the image of one race.

 Question about maltose binding protein article 

Hi Victor,

Just now I'm solving this problem with respect to this maltose binding protein tag, I found this article on wiki. And here is what you wrote:

""""...Once the fusion protein is obtained in purified form the protein of interest (X) is often cleaved from MBP with a specific protease. Protein X can then be separated from MBP by passing through the amylose column again.""""

It would be great if you can explain how can """"Protein X can then be separated from MBP by passing through the amylose column again"""" because I have tried it and it doesn't work. My personal guess is since MBP binds to maltose, it simply doesn't bind to amylose resins / column unless maltose is removed beforehand.

Then the question is how to remove maltose from MBP. From Davidson et al. Mechanism of maltose transport in Escherichia coli: Transmembrane signaling by periplasmic binding proteins (1992:

""""Preparation of Maltose-Free MBP

MBP was purified by affinity chromatography and was dialyzed extensively under conditions calculated to remove most of the bound maltose. For some experiments, MBP was denatured in 6M guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) and either dialyzed against 6M Gdn-HCl or passed through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 6M Gdn-HCl before renaturation by dialysis against 10mM KP1 (pH 7.0). UV-difference spectroscopy showed that the bulk of the MBP was free of maltose.""""

Hope to hear from you soon.

By trying to """"wipe out"""" Islamic extremists by using force we are only supplying the ISI with more excuses to brainwash Indian Muslims.The mullahs see India's tough stance against terrorism as proof that it is the Indian Government's intention to target Muslims in India.Before we shoot these extremist youth,we need to figure out why educated,young Kashmiri men turn themselves into suicide bombers overnight.The recent case where a Kashmiri man who was employed at an MNC {Johnson&Johnson;} chose to throw his life away and join the mujhahideen shows us how thouroughly the ISI backed mullahs have brainwashed Indian Muslims.Though the concept of suicide bombing is despicable,just take a moment and think how you would feel if you were a mujahideen.You would know exactly when you were going to die,you would know that you were going to be ripped apart by an explosion.Scary thought isn't it?Then what makes these mujahideen so desperate that they would endure this?This is what we need to figure out.The more the VHP tries to deny Muslims the right to live in peace,the more desperate they {the Muslims} will become.The VHP accuses Indian Muslims of being antinational,conveniently forgetting people like APJ Abdul Kalam or Abdul Hamid.""",0

I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush.

 links 

Dharmabum420 and others seem to enjoy removing links from the article. I am not a webmaster or even know one. I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link 
I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here.
I'll assume that it's not self-promotion despite the earlier """"greatest site ever!"""" type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons:
Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that.
No Google hit within the first 100 links in a """"pink floyd"""" search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site's notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites.
The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people's tattoos. While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos.
Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account.
The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try).
That's my 2¢ on this particular site. - a 

I'll double 's 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It's a very sub-par site and doesn't contribute anything to this article.  

I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states """"Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)"""" this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself. This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you

 Also now that I think about it, show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig, or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album? Not even DG.com has those avaialable anymore. Also how about the interview on the Roger waters tour page? Link the other fansite that has this. None do. This site was also the first that had Rogers complete touring band lineu",0

 Tyrannosaurus FA 

Hi Sandy, I was wondering if you would have a quick look at the Tyrannosaurus article and see if it looks to you to meet current FA standards?  I am wondering whether to initiate a discussion on it with a view towards it needing an FA review as the text to me seems repetitive, handling of units hap-hazard and inconsistent, significant overlinking, and needing some reorganisation.  I would welcome any thoughts you may have, and to be clear I am not asking that you take on the job, I just seek the view of an experienced FA contributor.  Thanks.    
 Hi, EdChem ... I'm sorry I have been of so little use in responding to your requests for help lately !  I've been quite busy in real life, so haven't had the time for the sustained commitment needed to review at the FA level, although I can occasionally dip in to DYK for a quick source review.  (Will respond to Tony's DYK issue as soon as I can I'm more concerned about sourcing, padding, and copyvio issues than how interesting hooks are at DYK I think interesting hooks might be a concern if the basic pillars of Wikipedia were being met, and I'm concerned that DYK is still a place where not even basic pillars that apply to all articles are upheld.)   When I was new to Wikipedia, dinosaur articles were all the rage; as often happens, it seems that many of the editors who maintained those articles have moved on.  At a quick glance, I can see numerous problems (as you outlined, including uncited text) with the article, but those problems aren't as bad as many older FAs that typically appear at WP:FAR.  It's not surprising that a high-profile topic like tyrannosaurus would deteriorate after its principle editors move on. Instructions at FAR ask that editors post to the talk page before initiating a review, in hopes that some interested editor will improve the article and remove the need for FAR.  You cannot go wrong by listing some of the obvious issues on talk to see if anyone will surface to work on the article.  If no one surfaces in say a month, I agree that the article probably needs to go to FAR.  But there are so many FAs in so much worse shape ... I digress )  Best,  (Talk)

 Re 

I don't understand you anymore. Until now i thought that you were an editor that has nothing to do but track my contributions and criticise me. But now i see that you throw all kinds of accusations that aren't true and that have the role of discouraging me in making future contributions. I say to you not to worry because everything you say against me or my contributions means absolutely nothing for me and sadly my oppinion of you just dropped to a level even lower than hell. I saw that you had all kinds of trouble in the Romanian Wikipedia on the same subject of blatantly criticising users and honestly i think you should keep your bad thoughts to yourself and try to help others a lot more. Instead of criticising and accusing you should try to help an article by adding what's missing or something else because ultimatelly you are an editor and nobody is perfect.

 Full listing of pages deleted in umbrella nominations 

Hi there. Would it be possible to have a full list of all the pages deleted as a result of the Esperanza MfD? Normally with umbrella nominations there is a record of all the pages deleted at the XfD page itself, but I don't think there was in this case. This case is complicated by the fact that several admins did the deletions. Trawling through the deletion log can also be a pain, unless you know of an easier way to do this.

Hey, thanks for participating in my recent RFA.  You were amongst a number of editors who remained neutral on the topic.  The RFA did not succeed (69/26/11).  I am extremely grateful that you took the time to advise me on to improve as a Wikipedian and I'd like to assure you that I'll do my level best to develop my skills here to a point where you may feel you could trust me with the mop.

I've been blown away by the level of interest taken in my RFA and appreciate the time and energy dedicated by all the editors who have contributed to it, support, oppose and neutral alike.  I hope to bump into you again soon and look forward to serving you and Wikipedia in any way I can.  Cheers!    (the non-admin, formerly known as Budgiekiller)

 A very Californian RfA thanks from  

  
 Thanks for your support in my not-so-recent RfA, which succeeded with a final tally of (97/4/4)! I've never been able to accept compliments gracefully, and the heavy support from this outstanding community left me at a complete loss for words  so, a very belated thank you for all of your kind words.

I have done and will continue to do the utmost to serve the community in this new capacity, wherever it may take me, and to set an example others might wish to follow in. With a little luck and a lot of advice, this may be enough. Maybe someday the enwiki admins of the future will look back and say, """"Yeah,  was an admin."""" Hopefully then they don't start talking about the explosive ArbComm case I got tied into and oh what a drama that was, but we'll see, won't we?

Surely some of you have seen me in action by now; with that in mind, I openly invite and welcome any feedback here or   help me become the best editor and sysop I can be.

Whilst Dr. Beck asked only that we take down the BDI-II, I still have to pay $4 a copy for the original BDI-I so I must assume that's under copyright and licence as well. I'm going to try and find some relevant bits from WP:C to justify (or not) removing the links. From what I can see the relevant text is here: 
Linking to copyrighted works
""""External sites can possibly violate copyright. Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Also, linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on us. If the site in question is making fair use of the material, linking is fine.""""
From what I can tell, I think that the sites that are hosting the BDI-I and BDI-II are violating copyright. Most of them don't say that they have permission to use the instrument, they don't cite the original paper, and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies. Now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with Harcourt individually, but it seems unlikely. A lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects; I don't think there is an exemption for educational use, but then university psychology departments often buy a """"portfolio"""" of test copyrights for limited use. This would not normally extend to use on the web however. In terms of next steps, I actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go, but rather we could list the issue at WP:CP?
If it's an issue of helping depressed people, I'm not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good. After all it just produces a number, it's only useful in context. One option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help . For instance, MoodGym is a site which allows users to self-administer cognitive behavioral strategies .

Why are so many of you acting like 8 year olds and ruining what used to be a decent page on Steve Jobs?  

His father was Paul Jobs - what dumb idiot called Justin changed it to Justin Paul Jobs?

He was born in San Francisco - look up the 2006 archives.

The purchase of what was later named Pixar, from Lucas, is fully covered in the archives.  The price, the date etc. From the official sales records.  Are you so lazy that you prefer to make things up rather than do decent research?  You only have to click """"Archives"""" on the discussion page.  What is so taxing about that?

So Insulinoma is the most common islet cell tumor of the pancreas.  And 80% of insulinomas have Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.  If he does he is at risk for a whole bunch of other cancers.  Do any sources say anything about this that we could add more information about his cancer.

 Jobs does not have pancreatic cancer 

Steve Jobs has a neuroendocrine tumor """"NET"""" that is located on his pancreas.  As a Carcinoid Cancer/NET survivor and activist, this is a very important distinction.

You quickly forget that I am objecting to the MISINTERPRETATION of a 'rule', and the MISAPPLICATION of a 'rule'.   (or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!
 Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, """"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this."""" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)
In response, I would have immediately said, """"Good question!""""  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   
But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, """"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit..."""").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.

So, if Middle Germany is """"misleading"""", and Central Germany is """"really wrong"""", what can we call it? -   

""""Middle Germany"""" is a germanism

Hi everyone,I turned this into a disambiguation page, with a new page for the economic & cultural region called """"central Germany"""" (Saxony(-Anhalt) & Thuringia), so please link accordingly. The German Wikipedia isn't arranged that way, but this isn't the German Wikipedia.

Also, I don't want to be dogmatic against the phrase """"Middle Germany"""" (I won't change this or this), but in English it's not common to describe central areas as """"Middle"""". The only other examples I could think of were Middle Earth and the Middle East (so-called because it's midway to the Far East), and apparently Middle Congo (Moyen-Congo) existed from c1903-1910.

Middle England and Middle America describe the social middle class - but the Metropolregion Mitteldeutschland called itself the Central German Metropolitan Region because that's the best translation.Thanks,   """,0

 You are one of the most pathetic administrators on this site. 

This is just plain sad. I am a susbcriber to Jane's Intelligence online, and I found the article easily. (you need to be a subscriber to access it, but it is certainly not hard to find). If you tally up the total UDA/UVF/LVF killed in the book lost lives (from 1968-1998) it shows 90 Loyalists killed by the IRA and INLA during that time period. The book """"The Irish War"""" also gives the number of 90, on the page I quoted, as does the Jane's intelligence report. That is THREE sources to the one source you quote. I am sick of having my hard work hacked up by some half-assed administrator who can't deal with the fact that his IRA article was full of innacuracies. I have contacted a friend of mine who is a senior administrator, you should be recieving an E-mail from him shortly. Unless you want your administrator privilages revoked, I suggest you either stop re-editing my article, or merge my facts with your own. I am pissed that I took the time to re-submit the article in the way you asked, and you are still throwing a hissy fit. You are one of the worst administrator's I have ever dealt with, you are the reason academics don't respect Wikipedia. 

PS. I realize you are a Loyalist terrorist supporter, and therefore can't deal with the fact that the IRA killed a large number of UDA/UVF/LVF members...but those are the historical facts, grow up and deal with it.

I will re-post my article daily to ensure that people who want a relaible article, can have one.""",1

Airport security required her to remove her bra in an airport bathroom in order to clear security, due to the fact that large under wire bras contain more metal than an average bra. As a result, Kates has stated that she plans to consult with an attorney as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women.""""

Hi  glad to see you expanding the Codex and Poole stubs, and thanks for your encouragement.  I'm sorry I fell off the face of the earth last year  if your hobby is hard work, mine might be sudden evaporation.

 Tip 

When the bot tells you that a vandal is a school IP, that should usually set alarm bells ringing. Considering it's probably some teenager on his lunch break, warning them probably isn't very productive . Personally, I think all school IPs should be blocked a son as they're identified as such since they're ususally pretty static and they bring nothing but vandalism, but then I also think logging in should be compulsory, so perhaps I'm just a pessimist! ;)  | Penny for your thoughts?

There were scholars and there is a classification system for fairy tales > Check out AT-number system at Antti Aarne: the Aarne-Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales. As Europeans and Near-Easterners travelled to the New World, the Far East, Africa, and other distant places, their tales migrated as well, often flourishing in their new environments. Hence, the Aarne-Thompson system encompasses tales found around the world. Cinderella is classified as 510A (see Cinderella), so is Rhodopis and Ye Xian.

There are several families of transposable repetitive elements. This article collectively calls them retrotransposons, and indeed several scientific articles agree with this definition. Searching a bit deeper, however, one finds a much more comprehensive and clarifying classification of these elements, whereby retrotransposons are only one class of them.

In some parts of Canada the situation is legislatively divided into warring U.S. and British camps . For instance, in British Columbia and Alberta, Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M.) still exist. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Yukon,and N.W.T standards are slightly higher and are based on quackery-based charlatan British Chiropodists who insist on calling themselves """"Podiatrists"""". In Manitoba, for example, about 15 or so quack Chiropodists insist on titling themselves """"Dr."""" despite having bogus (3-4 year) qualifications. This disgusting Manitoba movement is designed to blur the distinction between British Chiropodists and USA DPM's. In the province of Ontario, MAJOR differences in scope of practice exist. Consequently, there is still a title distinction between UK chiropodists and USA DPM podiatrists ( ie. American Doctors of Podiatric Medicine). Unfortunately, both share a governing body, the College of Chiropodists of Ontario. To accelerate Ontarians into confusing U.S. trained podiatrists with bogus UK """"podiatrists"""", the British Chiropodists who are in greater number, heavily lobby the provincial Government regularly into perpetuating & maintaining the banned prefix """"Dr."""" and the associated title """"podiatrist"""". Unbelievably, and quite maliciously, British Chiropodists have lobbied provincial legislators into forcing all USA DPM's who migrate after 1993 into accepting and only using the title chiropodist. This is plainly maliciously designed so that the Ontarian public cannot distinguish the vast difference in educational qualifications.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am so sorry to bother you, but I've seen your post on Processor Register, the original text is copied to bellow

| IA32e || 8 || 8 || Early concept of EM64T, coded name """"Yamhill"""". the register were extending from 32 bit to 64 bit. unlike x86-64 this design do not come with additional general purpose register(r8 ~ r15)and lack of 64 bit MMU and address mode. support 32 bit address mode with PAE for maximum compatibility with legacy application. early Prescott, Tejas and Timna were the only implement of this ISA and later is replaced by EM64T.

That is so interesting and amazing. Besides, I wonder the information on Operating Mode. Is the original IA32e mode a sub-Mode of protected mode or a new mode like it in AMD64? Does the original 32-bit protected OS need to be changed from the scratch or just provides extension support for those new introduced 64-bit instructions? That is most amazing thing for me.

Are you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering's attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man's lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his """"mouth"""", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this?

 Social Classes (for ex: 2nd class...) 
In Mesopotamia, they have 3 social classes: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. The kings, priests, and wealthy people
were in 1st class (the top). The 2nd class had merchants, fishermen, etc. They don't have wealthy houses, like the 1st class people have. Last but not least, the 3rd class. The 3rd class had slaves. The slaves are for to help and do work for the 1st and some 2nd class people. 

 King Hammurabi 
King Hammurabi ruled a place in Mesopotamia called Babylonia. He was a very tough king. He was one of the first kings to write laws for his people. But he was the first king to hang his rules/ laws up in every place in Babylonia, so if someone breaks the law, no one can complain or tell they never noticed or read the laws. These laws are called The Hammurabi Code. 

 The Hammurabi Code 
The Hammurabi code are laws written in stone. Scientists had found a stone of laws written by a priest that was told to write the laws that King Hammurabi said. one of the laws are """"If you kill a father's son in the fire, then your son will be killed in the fire too."""" or """"If you steal something during a fire, then you will chop off your hands.""""

 Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champions 

I am not and was never looking to start trouble, all I am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references.

The Triple Crown and the Grand Slam are what we have been going back and forth on.

My contention is that The Intercontinental and United States Championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a Crown/Slam.

You say no because WWE never explicitly came out and said so.

On 8-4-06, JBL said he was a Slam winner.  A WWE wrestler on WWE TV said he accomplished a WWE sanctioned feat.

It was said that no outside source has verified this, but no one in WWE has disputed JBL's claim either.

Also it must be pointed out that PWI has always considered the two championships as equal.

When PWI used to do their rankings for WWF and WCW, the I-C and U.S. Titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective World Champions.  The same holds true today when they do the rankings for Raw (I-C) and Smackdown (U.S.).

PWI is considered the main source for what is considered a """"World Title"""" and their word is law here on Wikipedia.

They also have always maintained that the I-C and U.S. Championships are of equal value and of equal standing.

As I have said before, I am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to Wikipedia, only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact, based on logic and references.

JBL, PWI, and many other wiki users have backed up this definition. (Look at the Triple Crown Champion Discussion page).

All I ask is my contribution be allowed to stand as I respectfully feel that I am in the right on this one.

Thank you for your time.

Don't blame me for the flaws in the system.

ArbCom had a choice: to cast this as an issue of foundation principles (which they could reasonably have involved themselves with) or to cast it as a content issue and dismiss it.  they decided to do the latter for reasons of their own.  C'est la vie.

it's not a huge issue; this will quickly end up on ArbCom's plate anyway as a matter editor behavior, from some place or other - there's just too much tension around this particular problem, and too many people acting out on it like children.  If arbcom needs the shit to hit the fan before they tell people to stop throwing shit, that's their business; I've decided I'm not going to be the one starting the shit-fight.

Hi Parutakupiu, there's no """"disturbance""""!  Sorry for not replying on the WikiProject page - sometimes I have an immediate opinion on a topic and I will reply quickly, and sometimes I need to think about something, so I take some time.

In this case, I guess I'm not sure about your proposal.  The templates certainly look good, so there's no issue there, but I'm weighing the pros and cons of another set of navigation boxes.  I think there are instances on Wikipedia where proper use of categories and list pages are probably sufficient to navigate a topic, and other places where navigation boxes really are desired.  For example, many athlete pages have an excessive use of navigation boxes, in my opinion.  Take a look at Toni Sailer, for example.  At least those five navigation boxes now utilize the show/hide feature - that page was very cluttered before.  Even so, I'm not sure that it is a natural way for readers to want to navigate through Wikipedia.  Do we really need a navigation box to go from one winner in a specific event at the world championships to the next?  Wouldn't it be just as easy to have a """"See also"""" section with links to List of Olympic medalists in alpine skiing and List of Alpine Skiing World Champions and navigate from there?

It's not exactly a parallel situation, but perhaps the concept is similar  the question to be answered is do we really need this new set of navigation boxes (which will number around 350-400 if we make them for all events) or are a set of categories and the existing medalist lists sufficient?  I currently don't have a solid opinion on this myself, so I haven't offered one in response to your request on the WikiProject page.  However, if you have a logical position to support whichever path you take, and can lay the foundation for a consistent implementation across all events (not just diving), then I would support you either way.  Consistency is my biggest concern here.  Hope this helps,  """,0

 Ragusa- Dubrovnik- has never been in Italy!
This article's statement in the part of """"Maratime Republics"""" claiming that Ragusa was in Italy and therefore implying that it was an Italian republic is clearly a mistake.
One just needs to go into the Sponza palace, the Ragusian state archive in Dubrovnik and see any of the official documents. The laws regarding inner policy are clearly stated in Croatian: Those regarding foreign policy are written both in Croatian and Italian. All of the ruling families of Ragusa from Sorkocevic to Gucetic to Restic etc were Croatian. The greatest Ragusian poet and writer Ivan Gundulic, an aristocrat and one of the rulers, famous for his book """"Suze sina razmetnoga"""", was one of the greatest Croatian nationalists.  Source: """"Dubrovnik, a history"""", written by Robin Harris 2006.
According to the Robert Harris book Malta was independent until 1808 when Napoleon annexed it. According to Harris Dubrovnik with it's fleet of 700.000 tons (surpassing Venice in 1660) was the main hated rival of Venice in the Adriatic and always resisted the invasion plans of Venice. The last Venitian rector was sent home packing- politely but firmly- in 1351. According to Harris the recto packed his belongings in a hurry.

Some reflections  on this issue are necessary

First, it is necessary a reflection on the very concepts of Nation and State as these two terms are commonly considered near-synonyms and therefore used interchangeably. They have, instead different meanings. The term Italy refers to booth meanings. Italy as State was born in XIX cent, but Italy as Natiom is much older. Almost true, Ragusa never belonged to Italy-State except the Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy (1808-1809), but was seen for some centuries a part of Italy-Nation in the beginning of its birth process. Today Ragusa/Dubrovink, as well as Split and other Dalmatian towns, are out of Italy-State and out of Italy-Nation as well, they belong both to Croatia-Nation and to Croatia-State. On the other hand Lugano (Switzerland) and San Marino (independent republic) are out of Italy-State and still part of Italy-Nation. I suggest the book: L. TOMAZ, """"Il confine d'Italia in Istria e Dalmazia. Duemila anni di storia"""" and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.87.9.19.187  

Romanians in 2007/2008

I think now that Romanians are the largest minority in Italy, someone should add this fact from this year.

 Random remarks 
:File:Boundaries of the Okinawan Languages.svg seems inaccurate. According to Karimata (2000), the western half of Onna Village is part of the Southern Okinawan-speaking region.
I think the """"phonemic"""" accent notation of the Nakijin Dialect Dictionary is actually phonetic but I leave it intact. A more elegant analysis is presented by Moriyo Shimabukuro's The Accentual History of the Japanese and Ryukyuan Languages (2007) although he did not discuss compounding.
The example of kumo (spider/cloud), originally added by , is not a good example. Kumo is a homonym in Tokyo Japanese only because an irregular sound change occurred in Tokyo Japanese. """"Cloud"""" belongs to the accent class 2.3 and """"spider"""" to 2.5. This pair is realized differently as HL and LF in Kyoto. The expected Tokyo forms are LH and HL, but they are both pronounced HL.

That makes sense to me. As I reflect on this, I think that part of the potential for confusion is that the point, as I understand it, is that UVA's E-School was the first one that was associated with a university AT THE TIME OF ITS FOUNDING, as opposed to one that became associated later (or one that was part of a school that expanded its mission). Perhaps another idea would be to say """"... the first to be founded as part of a university"""" or something similar to that? (I like the idea of the footnote with the stronger source either way, though. I recall there was a to-do about the Jefferson Society a while back and there was a question about whether their site was a sufficient source due to the notion that they have a conflict of interest in that they consider it prestigious to be the oldest debating society. The same argument might apply to the E-School's site insofar as they claim to be the oldest for prestige reasons.)   """,0

I see that Selena was on this list as having a stamp issued in 2006. I have removed her due to the fact that there were stamps, but they weren't issued by the USPS. The Selena stamps were issued by a company called Premier Postage. Their site claims to produce stamps using themes that are licensed by various folks that can be used as postage (the site also claims the USPS has authorized this). In Selena's case it appears her estate licensed her image to this company and they produced stamps. While these stamps may be valid for US postage, I feel she doesn't qualify for this list due to the stamps being issued by a private firm and not by the USPS.

I actually disagree with you, firstly whilst it may be the case that people are not required to explain their actions its merely good manners to do so and the request 'to do so' is that which makes good pages via clear and fair debates and discussions, hence the existance of these areas! Secondly a picture that represents a page should be that of a tidy and well presented image (regardless of the inane issues you talk about ie, weight - which should not even be an issue unless your ignorance truly knows no bounds!) and be reflective of what the person on the page is (in Kellys case a singer).

In this particular case - I am willing and open to accept the consensus again. If the majority vote selects your snapshot, I will go with it.

You are not afraid to wield unfounded mockery (poor photography = lmao) because the picture you are trying to force upon this page has absolutely nothing to offer, so you can't point anyone to anything worthy about it.

The unspoken and unexamined implication or assumption in the disputed section of this biography is that scientists such as Tour, Picard, and Skell are accurately described by the DI's claim that they are anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin and also supporters of the DI's political agenda, deserving negative publicity for taking such a laughable position.  Did Chang intentionally put that paragraph into his story to affirm the DI's characterization of those three scientists?  Or did Chang put that paragragraph into the story to cast doubt in the reader's mind on the DI's incredulous claim that all signers adhered to the DI's characterization of the signers?

Given that Chang reported both the DI's claims and the string of quotes revealing a mix of support and disdain among the petition signers, a neutral point of view requires that anyone reading Chang's article with a critical eye would ask the obvious question:  Is the reader supposed to take at face value the DI's naked claim that scientists such as those three are anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin who support the DI's political agenda?  Or is the reader supposed to take that paragragh as startling evidence that the claims of the DI stretch credulity.

The way the article is written, a casual reader could draw either conclusion.  A skeptical or fair-minded reader could also draw the conclusion that no firm conclusion can be drawn as to whether any of the signers fit the DI's characterization of them as anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin who support the DI's political agenda.

What conclusion did the various Wikipedia editors draw, and how do they justify treating any such conclusion as an established fact for the purpose of crafting authentic biographies of figures such as Tour, Picard, or Skell?",0

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.

 Plot 
I changed  this is a highly fictionalised account of Thompson and attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta's actual trip to Las Vegas around the same time period.
This is contracticed many times through out the article. In one instance, under the Pre production sub heading it says:
Depp remembers, """"He saved it all. Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse.

Later on under the sub heading Reaction, it says:
Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAM BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it.

I have never used swear words against him but have used descroiptions that are accurate. look at his recent self serving post on rod laver to carlo and his digraceful censorship of my legitimate  comments; he is not a censor or a dictator ' but acts like one; he needs to be brought to heel and your helping him because  your  stopping crticism of him. he is an absoloute disgrace. plenty of people have criticied him but he never, never apologises. its beyond a joke. its war as far as l'm concerned and its being going on for 5 months mate and is not going to stop  until he is broughy to book.

Here, Toby72 asked me to take a look at this. Here is what I saw in a not-so quick look at recent edits.
This 14 April version of the article had an initial paragraph in the Colonia Era section which was largely unsupported.
In this 15 April edit, Toby72 replaced this paragraph with new content, still largely unsupported. The new content changed the focus of the paragraph, removing a heavy weight previously given to rape in a master/slave relationship in favor of heavier emphasis on mulatto offspring.
In this series of three April 15 edits, DD2K reintroduced the emphasis on rape, citing supporting sources.
In this 15 April edit, Tobby72 reverted the DD2K edits, saying """"WP is not a blog"""".
In this 17 April edit, Tobby72 added and rearranged some material.
In this 17 April edit, anon 69.105.28.149 reverted the article back to its state as of the last edit by DD2K, without explanation.
In this edit, apparently not noticing that the article had been anonymously reverted to one of his prevvious edit versions, DD2K made some further edits to the article, saying, """"Undid revision 550678046 by Tobby72 (talk)Not weighted properly. Vast majority of scholars(and obvious common sense) state slave/master 'relationsips' were rape by the very nature"""".
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added and removed some material in this and other sections of the article. saying, """"readd quotes per WP:NPOV, plus add pics"""".
In this May 3 edit, DD2k reverted the prior edit by Tobby72, saying, """"...  rv- stop- If you want to make these kinds of controversial changes, use the Talk page.""""
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added a  tag to the section.

I think I've got that straignt. Some of the edits mentioned above were separated from one another by unrelated edits made by other users.

Guys, please re-read WP:BRD. I know that it is an essay and not a policy, but it does describe a workable method for reaching consensus by identifying objections to edits and keeping discussion moving forward and help towards breaking deadlocks. That Bold-Revert-Discuss method is much superior to the Bold-Revert-Unrevert-Edit war method which has been tried here. Regardless of how the section at issue got to be in its current state, can we please have some discussion aimed at establishing a consensus about what it ought to contain?

It looks to me as if the main area of disagreement is how much weight should be given to information about master-slave rapes in colonial America in an article on the topic of Mulatto, which the lead sentence describes as, """"a term commonly used in the United States to refer to a person who is born from one white parent and one black parent, or more broadly, a person of any 'mixed' ancestry."""" Input from editors not involved in the edit-warish exchanges above would probably be useful. I'll mention that this source might be useful. It speaks somewhat to the subtopic at issue here, though not from an American Colonial Era viewpoint.   (talk) (earlier Boracay Bill) """,0

It's a good suggestion. I would go a little further and offer this version of the entire paragraph that circumvents any mentioning of the 'claims':

""""Although the empire had a multi-ethnic character during its history and preserved Romano-Hellenistic traditions, it became known to most of its western and northern contemporaries as the Empire of the Greeks due to the increasing predominance of the Greek element. The use of the term Empire of the Greeks (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire also implied that in the West it was no longer seen as the Roman Empire. The authority of the Byzantine Emperor as successor of Roman Emperors, was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used the lack of a male occupant of the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself. Whenever the Popes or the rulers of the West made use of the name Roman  to refer to the eastern Roman Emperors, they preferred the term Imperator Romaniæ instead of Imperator Romanorum, a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors.""""

I'd leave the last sentence though since it demonstrates that there was still a certain ambiguity about how Popes and other western rules saw the Byzantine Empire.  """,0

49712,"Meijer Gardens, American Horse, Statue copyright
Hi Asher196. I have come here to follow up with you about Image:MeijerGardensAmericanHorse.jpg‎. I used to contribute a lot of images to wikipedia, back about a year and a half ago I would make trips to specific locations to take high quality pictures for inclusion on Wikipedia. In doing so, I learned more about copyright of photography than most lawyers do (because most lawyers do not work in the copyright space). Suffice to say that your perception of image copyright is an incorrect one. A summary of image copyright has been written elsewhere far better than I can try here, but i am so out of practice on WP I cannot find it. First, please carefully read the copyright template that I have placed upon this image. The image is copyrighted because it is a 2d representation of a 3d statue. Statues, just like paintings, soda can artwork, music and movies are copyrightable. As such, one cannot make derivitives of that work that one can license (i.e. take a picture). If one takes a photograph of a statue, the original copyright holder still retains rights over that image, rights that can only be bent through the implying the fair use provisions of copyright law.

I was involved in a rather epic struggle between good (fair use) and evil (anti-copyright) people on Wikipedia, one that we sadly lost because this project is dominated by people who are so leftist and anti establishment that they desire nothing short of completely free. Sadly, this is a battle my side eventually was overcome by noise and numbers generally, but even these nazi's must admit defeat in the face of being able to include photographs of statues. There is no other option. One simply cannot create public domain or freely licensable photographs of statues. I hope this post brings to you a greater understanding of copyright of images and will serve you in your future editing.",0

With all the fanfare, it is perfect timing for the Original Patent Troll to make his comeback in the recent re-release of The Patents Video.

In 1994, the Patent Troll made his first appearance in The Patents Video.  At its first release, The Patents Video was purchased by hundreds of corporations, universities, governmental entities and law firms.  In The Patents Video, an unsuspecting victim is surprised by the Original Patent Troll who strategically positioned himself to collect patent licensing revenue.

Using dramatic vignettes, entertaining scenarios, humor and expert advice, The Patents Video explains the most commonly misunderstood concepts and the most critical information about patents.  The Patents Video was designed to visually make key messages memorable.  Topics include intellectual property (IP) law basics, domestic and foreign patent bar dates, patenting of ideas, and claim language with respect to patent infringement.  

Engineers, scientists, marketers, managers, executives and corporate attorneys have a lesson in Bar Dates that no one forgets when they watch The Patents Video.   Og, a caveman in a dream, has invented the wheel.  Og and Thak push the wheel through downtown – all in public view.  The Patents Video, an entertaining educational tool, explains how and why Og and Thak have lost their foreign patent filing rights and explains, in detail, how to avoid triggering U.S. and foreign patent Bar Dates.  

A free viewing of a 3.5 minute clip from the 32 minute video is available by visiting www.ogandthak.com.   YouTube viewers give the clip Five Stars.

Even though he had some problems understanding some wikipedia policies, he did actually made some good contributions. This promotional spam you speak of, has developed to some war between Syriacs and Assyrians calling historical figures for Syriac or Assyrian. I'm personally of the opinion that it is correct to call some of them Syriacs, but calling some historical figures like Michael the Syrian for Assyrian (as you can see by the articles history) is just crossing the line (the term Assyrian haven't been used since the fall of the Assyrian empire until the the late of the 19th century).",0

Looking back, it appears that the article was Proposed for Deletion with the rationale that the group was non-notable, and that the article lacked sources and was abandoned. That was in September 2008; the edit prior to this was in November 2006. No one objected to the deletion, so I deleted it without prejudice. If you like, I am happy to restore what little was there to your userspace, so you have a template to start with. The only source was a zip archive of examples from the group. 

I don't know enough about the ANSI scene back then to judge notability in this case, but if you have sources that discuss the group in a neutral fashion, and if those sources are reliable, then I think an article might be worthwhile. So, let me know what you'd like to do and I'll take care of it. If you'd prefer a fresh start, that works too - your call. Best,   Said ~ Did",0

 stop stupid acusations 
I find it unacceptable to delete peoples contribution without any comments. I have now been repeated acused of writing a long rant while all my modifications thereof have been reverted. 

There is no OFFICIAL evidence incriminating Osama as the eavil doer. 
This reenforces why all acusations of muslim terrorist attack should have proper quotation.
If you lack such sources (which I claim you do) we do not need your opinion to provide the rest of reality.

Your lies as """"the truth"""" here in wikipedia
The suggestion there would be sufficient proof or even mainsteam consensus about the event is a clear lie. I personally find it unimaginable that wikipedia has a page where Muslim Extremists are claimed to be the cause leaving no room for any sensible explaination.

no referrences to  Obstruction of justice huh? 
The article should clearly mention the great effort the Bush administration made of hiding all the evidence. This was the main embodyment of the attack. Obstruction of justice of this scale is a far bigger crime as murder.

FOLLOW THE MONEY!
The page should mention Lary Silverstein owned the building for a day and a half and maxed out the insurance for multiple terrorist attacks. Thus he cashed in multiple times.

the muslim extreamist terrorists label kit
A discussion about using the word Terrorist seems to provide an interesting vessle to obstruct the discussion. It has repeatedly been made clear the word terrorist attack can be used to explain the event but there is no ground to keep calling those who staged the event muslim extreamist terrorists.""",1

Given that the rate of growth of FAs is AFAIK greater then one a day this isn't likely to change anytime soon. TFA is really somewhat seperate from the FA process, the only connection is that TFAs must be FAs of course. Being a TFA should be thought of as a bonus more then anything else and there's nothing intrinsicly different between an FA which has been TFA and one that hasn't; they're all FAs and if they not they should be put up for FAR.

But please note: be bold in updating pages does not mean that you should make deletions to long articles on complex, controversial subjects with long histories, such as Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Abortion. In many such cases, the text as you find it has come into being after long and arduous negotiations between Wikipedians of diverse backgrounds and points of view. An incautious edit to such an article can be akin to stirring up a hornet's nest, and other users who are involved in the page may react angrily.

If you encounter an article on a controversial subject that you would like to edit, first read the comments on the talk page and view the Page history to get a sense of how the article came into being and what its current status is.

If you are an experienced wiki-ist, you will probably have a good sense what will be accepted edits, and which edits should be discussed first.

If you are new to wikipedia, or unsure how others will view your proposals, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, you should either:

   1. If the material in question is a sentence or so in length, copy it to the Talk page and list your objections there.
   2. If the material is longer than a sentence, list your objections on the Talk page but leave the main article as it is.

Then, wait a bit for responses. If no one objects, proceed. But always move large deletions to Talk and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page.

Also, show respect for consensus. Avoid making major changes to an article if a vote (or poll) is currently in progress about whether those changes should be made, especially if there is no clear consensus shown by the vote.

65759,"Seems like a lot is missing from this article, especially the part about the atom bomb.
Here's a few reviews from Amazon.com:

A fiercely nationalistic book every American should read, August 5, 2002 

This book was a million-seller in Japan, and was translated into English in 1991. The author was a promininet Japanese politician. The book is dated, and history has not always borne out the author's views. Nonetheless, anyone attempting to understand modern Japan should read it. Some of the passages will be very surprising and disturbing. 
Author Ishihara avoids the conventionally polite Japanese protocol and forcefully states that Japan is the equal of the United States, that Japan should have its own defense forces, (and strong ones), that Japanese computer technology is second to none and should be used as a negotiating tool, and Japan will be the most influential power in dealing with Asian nations. 

Ishihara berates America for racism, and contends that the atomic bomb was not used on Germany because Germans were white, and Japanese were yellow. He asserts that nations colonized by Japan have been far more successful following liberation than those colonized by the United States. 

The book exemplifies the growing trend toward national pride in Japan, and also forcefully addresses the feeling by many Japanese that their nation is misunderstood. 

Plainly, the sentiments in the book foretell a troubled period in Japanese-American relations, and remind us that the Japanese have not forgotten Hiroshima any more than America has forgotten Pearl Harbor. Ishihara's call for a constructive dialogue between the two nations is well taken. Otherwise, the future looks cloudy at best. 

Very highly recommended, even if slightly dated. 

emblematic parochialism and obscure nationalist rage, September 19, 2006   

I read this book in the CIA-translated version as a Senate aide concerned about the rise of Japan, which included as co-author one of the leaders of Sony (Morita). While interesting for scholars, as I glanced thru this version - which is watered down but still white hot with anger - I was struck at how far off base the predictions of the man seem today. Afterall, when it was written, Japan was at the crest of the bubble economy, it appeared as if Japanese computer chips (and its electronic industries) would confer great power on the country (they could refuse to sell components that went into US missiles), and the US was in a now-unimaginable phase of self doubt. As such, the way things have turned out, after nearly 16 years of stagnation and the rise of high tech manufacturer-competitors elsewhere, reveal the author to have been so badly mistaken regarding the trajectory that Japan would take as to be laughable. 

In a deeper sense, it points to the fact that Ishihara did not understand the economic forces at work at the time and so was full of utterly baseless nationalistic bravado. Japan's economic rise was based upon the post-war reconstruction boom, then a relatively protected economy that allowed huge undustrial combines to band together as cartels (gouging their won consumers to sell at low prices abroad to gain marketshare and crush competitiors), and lastly to a number of significant management innovations (TQM, just-in-time manufacturing, etc.) that are reflected in the fact that they make excellent cars. However, it was basically a follower economy making products that have become commoditized by cheaper manufacturers elsewhere in Asia - just as its innovations became widely emulated - and corrupted by the money generated in real estate speculation that eventually collapsed in a deflationary spiral. Meanwhile, its political reforms have been weak at best, and senselessly nationalistic at worst. 

Ishihara understood none of this and casts no light on any of it of value. Instead, he drags out pre-WWII arguments about the innate superiority of the Japanese character and similar rather ugly arguments. He is also appalingly loose with the facts: for example, he claims that the US bombed Japan, but not Germany with the atom bomb for racist reasons (Japanese were yellow, Germans were not) - but if you know a minimum of history, which Isihara apparently doesn't, you would realise that at the time of the German defeat (April, 1945) the bomb was not yet completed (it was first test detonated the following July)! The book is full of this kind of sloppiness. What he does succeed at, however, is expressing the resentment that parochial Japanese nationalists felt at the time. In retrospect, his arrogance appears as breathtaking as it is ignorant. But his anger and resentment, and what they reflect of Japanese attitudes, is very real indeed. Seen this way, the book is one long crypto-racist rant. 

Japan has a long way to g",0

Any material that is challenged and for which no source is provided may be removed by any editor. So we don't need a poll, all we need is to remove a lot of things from the page. It needs to be rewritten having both published versions, the scientific one and the warmongering story.

Unless anyone has a good reason not to add those to the page and not to mention this documented information?

William Rodríguez RICO lawsuit
In October 2004, Rodríguez filed a civil RICO lawsuit directed against George W. Bush, Richard B. Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld and others, including a total of 100 defendants, together with Ellen Mariani and lawyer Phil Berg. The government filed a motion to dismiss, or at least transfer, the case on grounds of national security. is worthy of it's own paragraph.

no Osama means no Muslims
[FBI says]: The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 thus the word Muslim may only be quoted at best.

The use of the word terrorist
Similarities between the Reichstag fire and The September 11 Attacks are as striking as those between the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Patriot act there is no need to use the word terrorist to explain the event, I do think a separate paragraph dedicated to the media calling it a Muslim terrorist attack would be appropriate. Wikipedia:Avoid_peacock_terms Let the facts speak for themselves..

Wikipedia:No original research

As long as it's not in a peer review journal kerosene cant melt reinforced steel. 
Structural failure
In a well-designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure.

Which makes this pseudoscience: September_11_attacks#The_attacks: Three buildings in the World Trade Center Complex collapsed due to structural failure on the day of the attack. Because that is not what the structural failure of well designed systems works like in any previous historical event. Here the standards of wikipedia go far beyond those of the mainstream media. The buildings where blown up.

Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words

Wikipedia Regrets The Errors

[Suggested Text]:

From June to September of 2007, several false and misleading critical statements appeared at the National Civilian Community Corps (also known as AmeriCorps NCCC) page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Civilian_Community_Corps), in violation of Wikipedia standards.  This is the false text as it appeared:

National Civilian Community Corps

""""...Criticisms
The NCCC program has met with sharp criticisms from some fiscal conservatives who accused it of being a """"boondoggle"""".[4] Most notably, Libertarian pundit and commentator James Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud""""[5], in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years."""" Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it """"a fraud"""".
^ http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188385,00.html ^ http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm""""

Wikipedia relies on its readers and volunteer contributors to avoid or challenge and correct misleading or false information.

The following has been called to our attention:

1.  The statement that read """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud,"""" cited as its source an article at this address by Bovard: http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm  Nowhere in that article does Bovard make that statement.  No mention of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor of the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" appears in that article, nor is AmeriCorps NCCC called a 'waste and fraud.""""  We regret the error.

2. The same sentence went on to state the following:  """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud"""", in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain ...""""

Upon investigation, this statement turns out to be untrue.  Bovard's book (published in hardcover by St. Martin's press) does not contain a chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC in the book """"Feeling Your Pain.  In fact, neither """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor the """"National Civilian Community Corps are mentioned at all in the text of that book nor in the book index.  (The chapter in question concerns the umbrella program, AmeriCorps, but does not mention the program known as """"AmeriCorps NCCC'"""" or the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""".

(The only mention to NCCC is in the footnotes, referring to a speech by then-president Clinton, praising, not criticizing, the NCCC.)

In sum, the book """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not dedicate """"an entire chapter of criticisms"""" of AmeriCorps NCCC, contrary to the information posted at the Wikipedia website.  We regret the error.

3.  Also untrue was the sentence """"Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it [i.e., AmeriCorps NCCC] """"a fraud"""".  This sentence was misleading and false.  It was placed at the National Civilian Community Corps page and referred to the antecedent in the previous sentence, the AmeriCorps NCCC.

The claim relied on the article by Bovard at http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm.  No mention of either the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" nor of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" appears in that article.  No evidence has been put forward to support the statement that Mr. Sweet ever labeled AmeriCorps NCCC a """"fraud.""""  We regret the error.

Wikipedia deeply regrets that this misleading text appeared at our National Civilian Community Corps website and that it persisted for as long as it did.

The editor responsible for its appearance and continued re-emergence will no longer have access to the National Civilian Community Corps Wikipedia entry.

Signed: _____

Calls to move forward on the National Civilian Community Corps page, to be a team player, etc., would be better received by this editor if Wikipedia posted a note something like the above at the NCCC site  - not to mention, it might restore some of Wikipedia's credibility on this subject.   Given the nature of the NCCC - a substantial and serious component of U.S. disaster relief and mitigation capacity - and its recent near-demise following misleading claims like those posted at Wikipedia, the statement above is not written as amusement.

There you have it. Noel Malcolm is revered and aknowledged as a neutral and impartial historian. But just because he isn't on of your Serbo-bloggers, you come up with all this shit about his works. When he says """"conquered"""", that is exactly what the term means. Your map is shit. Because Serbs ONLY MADE UP 25% of that land whether it was a bigger or smaller Kosova than today. And I call it KOSOVA because KOSOVA is it's name. It's Serbo-nationalists like you, Dab, and Balkanfever who keep it in it's Milosevic devized name. And you keep going on about the Treaty in London 1913. Well???? What happened???? Certainly nothing to do with Kosova joining Serbia because I said before and I'll say again - if it did, Malcolm would have said it. If he gets things wrong, why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness. Answer that one. Dab, don't confuse the issue. It doesn't matter if Kosova was once it Italy, I tell you that it has never been in Serbia, it only had the bad luck to be in the same """"genocide state"""" as Serbia when a part of Yugoslavia.

 """"Supershadow"""" the next Director?

I think I read somewhere that a """"Supershadow"""" will direct 2-4, and perhaps even film sequels (Episodes 7-9). Please post to User_Talk:Shultzii if you have any pertinent information.
SuperShadow is one of the biggest liars on the net. He has made hundreds of claims since the beginning of the prequels claiming he is friends with George Lucas himself. Shadow has even contradicted himself many times. The guy seems to really enjoy lying to the star wars community. There won't be a 7, 8, or 9, either directed by Lucas or SuperShadow, just this TV series. SuperShadow is just some loser named Mickey Suttle. He is hated at the worst level by most of us fans who know the truth behind his lies. Check out Supershadow for more information on this moron.

The easiest thing to do if you think an article should be created is to create it and then mark it as a stub.  Otherwise, you can list your request on a subpage of Wikipedia:Requested articles.  But all the Star Wars movies, of course, already have articles.  See the bottom of Star Wars for links.

Unfortunately the site search for Wikipedia is rubbish.

Obviously Green Lantern or Robin are examples of a superhero name taken by several individuals, but the standard seems to be to create a 'main' article about the character name/legacy and give some details about each.  If more detail is needed/warrented, provide a link to the 'main article'.  Obviously this is also affected by the significance of the character.  Starman (comics) for instance gives descriptions of all of the many characters with that name, but only re-links to those individuals who have been notable using that psuedonym.  For Shadowhawk it seems as if the mantle of this character was passed cleanly from one person to another, so I'd say keep it all in one article as with articles such as Phantom Lady or Black Canary.",0

Its interesting the Catholic Futurism and Modern Critical Scholarship find their basis in Porphyry a pagan philosopher who railed against Christianity and especially against Bible prophecy in the 4th century.  I don't find it at all curious that John J. Collins, as a Catholic, promotes Modern Scholarship and Futurism.  Its what I'd expect.
Whenever you take on any part of the topic of Bible prophecy you can expect that it is a huge undertaking, because there is nothing simple about it.  One might limit oneself to just a single viewpoint, but that's not what Wikipedia is about.  You have to have a NPOV, and to do that with Bible prophecy you have to discuss just about every aspect of it.",0

59715,"Are you there? This needs your URGENT attention Sue Anne. Cmon, surely you should ACT atleast this time.

Hi,

Are you there Sue Anne? This needs your urgent attention.

Apropos my earlier message to you, I removed the pathetic PA from Royboycrashfan 's talk page and warned Crossmr against the PA along with a fair note. Please do read that note.

But he removed my first warning and also reverted back the pathetic PA comment on roy's user page ALONG WITH pathetic PA's AGAIN, in both edit summaries.

I gave him a final warning as he repeatedly violated NPA and would not cease and desist.

Yet he continued with his same unacceptable behaviour.

The edit histories of the talk pages of User_talk:Royboycrashfan and User_talk:Crossmr will make this very clear. He keeps deleting and reverting along with PA's in the edit summary inspite of being EXPLICITLY warned.

This is totally unacceptable. Please do take immediate action.

You know me, atleast a little. There is no way anyone can get away with calling me a vandal. You know I am not here to vandalize, but I have contributed meaningfully to a few articles whatever little time I have been on here.

Of course, there were a few misinformed civil issues along the way (which served to inform me about the policy on civility, NPA etc.), but after the block and blowing off a little steam, my behaviour has been perfectly good as can be expected of any genuine user.

even Vesther for that matter with whom I had a little argument would not call me a vandal.

Also there is another admin Nearly Headless Nick who has appreciated my edits to a certain page. 
Also have made a few edits to other articles the few times i was on.

But surely just because anyone is a very occasional user, that CANNOT be used as an excuse for letting anyone get away with PAs.

Also, NPA specifically states that earlier misinformed mistakes and behaviour CANNOT be used as an EXCUSE for a PA. 
If people kept harping on about old issues, it would become acceptable to attack anyone as everyone makes mistakes in the past.

Crossmr  just CANNOT be allowed to get away with his unacceptable MALICIOUS behaviour.

Please BLOCK him symbolically for whatever time you feel is right, to mainly PREVENT him and later forbid him from:

1. Reverting the pathetic PA on Roy's page along with the pathetic PA edit summaries.

2. Removing my very first warning message with a very civil note. I dont care about the second warning, but the first warning serves as a placeholder for record's sake.

Even after EXPLICIT and SPECIFIC warnings not to continue, he continued with his unacceptable behaviour and BLATANTLY violated NPA that too in edit summaries.
Even after being explicitly advised to assume good faith (AGF), he has failed to do so.

Cmon, for whatever you think of me (ur earlier silence), you KNOW I am not a vandal.

Please take appropriate steps as a fair and upright ADMIN.

I am logging off now, other stuff to do. Will log on tomorrow.

I do hope and expect you to symbolically block Crossmr, which will prevent him from continuing to behave unacceptably as he has blatantly violated NPA even after being repeatedly warned about it.

Thank you.

Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans.

A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who """"owing to a well-founded fear"""" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and """"unable"""" or """"unwilling"""" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum. The 1951 Refugee Convention: http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.

65669,"OVERVIEW:

Crunch (AGT Crunch Acquisition, LLC) is a fitness-based enterprise that is focused on making entertainment an integral part of the exercise experience. Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.

FEATURES:

1)TABGROUP FITNESS CLASSES
Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:
Urbanathlete (Action Sports)
This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. 

Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)
Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.

Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)
Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.
In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.

2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING
Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”

3) EQUIPMENT
All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  

4) SPECIAL EVENTS AND UNIQUE OFFERINGS
The following is taken from Crunch’s current press kit regarding special events and unique offerings: 


Crunch health clubs are home to a unique fusion of entertainment and fitness, one that we have pioneered from our inception and continue to explore through a number of different channels. In-gym parties and performances (by students of Scratch DJ Academy), an outdoor summer concert series, partnerships with cutting-edge theatrical productions like Spiegelworld and Fuerzabruta and our Broadway Dance Series are all hallmarks of this exploration. Additionally, we’ve developed a number of events that take place outside of our gyms, like field trips (which are held year-round in all of our markets and vary greatly in destination) a",0

I make no claim of comprehensiveness for the languages spinoff. I just tried to hit the major languages and regions. I believe Armenian is mentioned once in the Christian section.

4133,"As far as presenting sources are concerned, the book The life and exploits of Alexander the Great  sites much more sources in detail than source, which I think refers to some sources already referred by others. As such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the Author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher. Its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps, perhaps not. As far as the Author is concerned, in my understanding, he himself suggested that the story of Alexander that originated from Egypt should be considered more authentic than others ( reasons given as ..it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history, whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat; to these countries, then, we must not look for the original Alexander story. Similarly, we must not look to the states of Greece for it, because at the death of Alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of Macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples. One country only could be the birthplace of the Alexander story, and that country was Egypt..). I am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i.e. keeping the Alexander story from Egypt as authentic (which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources, especially ones from Greece that perhaps dominate current understanding). This according to me, forms one of the essence of the Alexander story, and I hope someone clarifies which story is the Egypt story in the said book which I myself is unsure for I don't have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off Egypt origins. At the most I can only hope that someone will research into the Alexander story from Egypt, and not his fanboy fantasies from Greece, to put forth a credible understanding if not already done.

 NPOV tag - Overwhelming transhumanist POV 

In the real world, mind uploading and mind transfer is overwhelmingly a literary trope. As science, it's not even clear the concept of an uploadable mind (the materialist equivalent of a soul) even makes sense. This article reads like an advertisement for the transhumanism/singularity/cryonics belief cluster.

Suggestion: if the text can't have the overwhelming sense of reading like an Alcor advertising brochure taken out, then rename this to """"Mind uploading (Transhumanist belief)"""" or similar and write an article about the concept in fiction (science fiction, fantasy, humour) with a small bit having that as a subarticle -   """,0

I haven't done anything within any reasonable representation of the realms of disruption since the mass AFD noms.

 Request opinion of Muslim editor 

Hello. Could you please stop by Talk:Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[Ousia|essense] of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[tritheistic]we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say """"Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers."""" Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying """"Christianity believes it believes that there is one God,"""" which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right), and if not, aren't Christians by definition monotheistic? Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot of debate I had to summarize. Thanks, — """,0

 European Borders 

There is a BIG problem going on about whether Republic of Georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in Europe or not .As you know there is no official border between europe and Asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is LOGICAL to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page..........      well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time I changed it, it went back to the previous version. now I am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. They should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version  and not even bothering to explain why, it is unacceptable. I contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she """"thinks it is the most neutral one"""". I am sorry but what some users """"think"""" should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be Credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an OFFICIAL border ! Council of Europe, the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european,  country is in the middle of the NATO membership process (only european countries are eligible for it according  to the North Atlantic Treaty) and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. Turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the EU. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined OFFICIALLY all of the versions should be included. I really want to ask someone to take care of it as they dont seem to understand my very logical argument and even used some rude words in private messages.  """,0

It's just I'm not fimiliar with all the precedures of writnig an article

Now,
I opened Future world music official website  and found some information about the movies they made songs for
So, I just typed thier names in this article
Then, I found some info about Future World Music in the same site  so, yes, I admit, I copied it but it was a couple of sentences only!!
At last, I havent finished the article yet, and was planning to continue to inhance it and adding the references """"The official site""""

So, please, what's wrong??
And, how to avoid that again for this exact article??
What should I do to make it accepted??

 To all editors: please note that the concerns brought up by 58.96.94.12 were addressed in my last edit of the article. I added the """"Criticisms"""" section, which details the only peer-review paper published in a physics journal critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory while also giving a number of non-refereed book review articles which have been critical of the Omega Point Theory. Keep in mind that Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so the """"Category:Pseudoscience"""" tag is factually incorrect and violates Wikipedia's policies of WP:Truth, WP:NPOV and WP:Reliable Sources. Yet still, 58.96.94.12 complains, even though he as yet has not stated what is wrong with the current edit. It appears that 58.96.94.12 simply wants some notice or tag on this article telling people that it is bilge and that they oughtn't sake it seriously.

Humans have evolved from primates. There are the alpha males, the regular males and the females. Gay males have female minds. At one point in human embryonic development all people were once female. That is why males have nipples. Females have the ability to achieve a muscular orgasm just like a male, however most women do not know how.
Women can have a muscular orgasm if they repeatedly squeeze the vaginal muscle used to urinate.

 Requesting information on a banned user 

Dear Mr. Chapman:

I write to you to request information regarding the blocking/banning of User:Mr Spunky Toffee, sockpuppet of User:Brian G. Crawford.  I ask because I had a run-in with him a couple of months ago, in which he attempted to delete a page I had written and insulted me repeatedly.  I was intrigued (but not altogether surprised) to discover a few days ago that he had been blocked as a sock-puppet, but I do know that he had a long history of personal attacks on other users.

What I would like to know is, what was it that got Brian G. Crawford banned from Wikipedia in the first place?  He is not listed on Wikipedia:List of banned users, nor is he included in the Category:Banned Wikipedia users.  His user page states that """"This user is banned from all Wikimedia projects by order of the Foundation.""""  But, the Wikipedia:Banning policy page states that """"The Wikimedia Foundation has the authority to ban users, though it has not exercised this authority on the English Wikipedia.""""

So frankly, I am a bit confused as to what went on here, which is why I am asking you, as you are the one who discovered that Mr Spunky Toffee was Crawford's sockpuppet.  I will understand if this information is confidential or otherwise unavailable; if this is the case please let me know on my talk page.  Or, if you would rather talk to me in private (by e-mail or otherwise), let me know and I would be happy to accommodate you.

I thank you in advance for your assistance.

I would appreciate it if you would fix up your 'allegience' portion of the table per the Australian standard. 0-5.99 is marginal, 6.00-10.00 is fairly safe, 10.01> is safe. Thankyou.   
It's better to go by the AEC than the ABC. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Australian_politics/Archive_2#Election_campaign_articles where we established consensus that 0-5.99/6-10/>10 should be used for this page.    

Per the link above, the Australian Electoral Commission as well as SA's State Electoral Office use 0-5.99 marginal, 6-10 fairly safe, and >10 safe. On wiki we have also used >20 as v.safe. This is what has been agreed upon per the consensus in the link above and is used on all pages that relate to it such as the other link above. Thanks.     
    
Ah. Well, per the link above, there is a ref which is http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/hass/staff/pendulum_new.pdf - a very good resource, post-redistribution, and then the standard 2004 results from the AEC which are in the division page refs, such as http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-12246-190.htm .     
    
No sorry.     
    
Nice work with all the infoboxes, but it was previously agreed here that infoboxes were superfluous to the article (you'll note that I preferred them to be included). In the interests of consensus, please raise this issue at the above link before adding any more, otherwise there may be a lot of removal, as I had to do earlier! Thanks.     
    
On another note, can I suggest that the infoboxes include the electorate's namesake?      
   
Additionally (I sound like I'm quibbling, I know - I do like the look of the new infoboxes) - are you able to make a template? This would make the inclusion and maintenance of the infoboxes much, much easier.      
    
The ones being used for the Sydney ones are out of date, representing the electorates as of 2004. I don't know if the others are uploaded yet.      
   
I've fixed the template up now, and changing them to templates. I hope you don't mind, but I removed some of the categories - I don't think anywhere provides information on population or density, and the """"last election"""" section is redundant as there's a table on that further down - and (I don't know if this was you) I'm making the allegiances according to the marginal-fairly safe-safe criteria used on the AEC, and I added the classification (inner metropolitan etc.) to the tables. If there are any problems with this please let me know!

Skywriter: I have tried to be civil with you.  I would ask that you return the favor.  Remember, I didn't even write the old lede; I picked that as merely being most likely to be non-controversial.  Also note that on every single edit page, there's a big statement saying """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""  Part of the """"edited mercilessly"""" part is that people will criticize your writing.  It's nothing personal.

""""If you see no evidence that Kinzer's book brought about a massive reassessment of the 1953 coup in Iran, then you did not read the book or the reviews.""""

Amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is, merely how good one is.  But whatever, you didn't include a direct mention in the most recent version, so let's just drop this.  (And for about the billionth time, since you mention in my edit summary that I'm """"criticizing"""" Kinzer....  I'm doing no such thing.  I'm sure the book is very good, judging from the review given by the CIA history fellow.  But """"very good"""" is not the same as """"an element of crowning importance in the coup itself.""""  People knew after 1979 that something had gone horribly wrong, so this was not a new revelation.

""""Aggression aside, SnowFire, the underlying flaw in your windy analysis is the absence of credible sourcing"""" 

You said earlier that """"Your other comments are too general to address. If you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording, feel free to bring it here for comment.""""  I decided to expand on the many problems with the lede, and now it's a """"windy"""" analysis.  Got it.  But aside from sniping, you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing.  It has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede.  There are a million and one possible, sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede; we have to pick which ones.  I have no doubt that your text was sourced; it doesn't mean it's automatically appropriate for the lede.

Yes, and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night. Fast and loose with facts,

Let me say it again: Are you denying that Cold War paranoia had anything to do with the coup?  Do you realize what references are for?  It's to confirm facts.  This fact is obvious and supported by every source, including your own, so it doesn't particularly matter what it was referenced to.  If you want to source it better have a blast, but this is not even close to """"fast and loose with the facts.""""

Albright's """"apology""""

You've got a point that the linked NYTimes article doesn't call it apology.  Remember, I didn't write the old lede!  Fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than we'd like.

The CIA does cite vague fear of the Soviet Union in its most recent justification for the coup. However, the CIA's accounting, published in 2007, three years after the publication of Kinzer's path-breaking book (2003), must be weighed against the CIA's destruction of most of its documents related to this coup

Wait, the CIA destroyed the documents, so therefore the Soviet Union had nothing to do with it?  That logic doesn't flow.  More to the point, the idea that Cold War machinations were behind the US involvement is in literally every source.  I haven't read All the Shah's Men, but from your linked book review (the one by a notable person, not from Amazon reviewers), it seems to be in that, too!  I quote..

Eisenhower and his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by Moscow's machinations.

Kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic John Foster and a cynical Allen.

By ignoring the anticommunist basis of US policy, he wrenched the dispute with the AIOC out of its Cold War context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint. Lastly, Mossadeq's naïvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the Tudeh Party's efforts to penetrate and control Iranian institutions. He seemed almost blithely unaware that pro-Soviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of Eastern Europe. By not reining in Iran's communists, he fell on Washington's enemies list. https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol48no2/article10.html

....yeah.  As a reminder this is from a review of your favored source.  (Also note that Dulles is described as """"moralistic,"""" i.e. interested in stopping the communists, not greedy / interested in oil.  Squares with what I know of Dulles anyway.)

 Islam Under Attack!!! 

Islam is under serious attack by some people! They have written serious criticisms against it. They include the following website articles of Jesus Greater Than Mohammed, Main Quotes In The Koran, Main Topics In The Koran, Why Nobody should Become A Muslim, Islam - A Case Of Mistaken Identity, and The Russian and Muslim Invasion Of Israel.

I don't mean to be biased or offensive by saying this. I'm just telling and informing you about those criticisms.

I want you to read and look at those criticisms so that you can (or can try to) refute, dispute, argue against, respond to, and react to them.

Can you please tell and ask other Muslims to look at those criticisms? Can you also please tell them to (or to try to) refute, dispute, argue against, respond to, and react to them?

There is a section in Islam - A Case Of Mistaken Identity called """"Questions to ask"""". You and other Muslims should especially look at that part, and try to answers those questions.

Since you can only be born in one place as long as its understood the last term is country of birth then people will naturally understand the rest. Obviously we may end up with descriptors containing four genetic heritages since we all have four grandparents. We would have to use continent descriptors for the genetic heritage part: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America (and whatever else people feel needs to added).",0

[edit] Gundagai
Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) """"""",1

1 proceeding or progressing inconspicuously but harmfully (an insidious disease).
2 treacherous; crafty.
insidiously adv.
insidiousness n.

[Latin insidiosus ‘cunning’ from insidiae ‘ambush’ (as in-2, sedere ‘sit’)]

Perhaps it should be mentioned that the in- morpheme that prefixes the word insidious, is peripheral in meaningfulness, and that the """"sidious"""" element has its root in LAtin insidiae ‘ambush’. So the word ambush should have some relevance in an etymological discussion. - CaptainSurrey""",0

Let's start over...

This is not going anywhere, except towards mediation. Though I agree more or less completely with Justin's edits, you both need to calm down. The spelling/language issue is pointless, as are the insults, as are the reverts, and the misleading and/or rude edit summaries. Who cares which version is online for two or three hours, if it's going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed? So let's focus on the debate, and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content, and then do changes step-by-step. To improve the mood here, I think Daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts, while Koavf really needs to respect that Daryou's not a native speaker, and not harass him over this. (And I need to stop sounding like my mom.)
 Mincom, the Moroccan government's own site, is of course propaganda, by every definition of the word, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a source - for what Morocco's government thinks and says. On the other hand, pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact, is obviously not how this should be done.
 Inserting that Western Sahara was """"peacefully ... liberated"""" by Morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far, Daryou. I think you've been trying to make that point all along, consistently in all of your edits, but you used to be better at hiding it.
 Questions remain above to be answered, with arguments, not reverts or insults.
 That's my input for today, and, yes, I think mediation could be a good thing. I was hoping we could settle this one through discussion (it has worked before!), but I've lost hope by now.

I would put those at or around his skin color at 10% tops, with those lighter than him much less than that. However, the pictures that you linked to seem to have bad lighting, which is why he appears darker than in other shots. If you look here, for example, you'll see that he's not actually that dark.

Well, 4twenty42o, I certainly don't put on any show here, but if you find it amusing, please have a laugh. Certainly I don't see any fun in it whatsoever. I sure hope that NeilN would take another approach and not jump the gun as he certainly did this time. Also, yes, I am frustrated, and I most certainly have the best reason in the world for that. Mario Roering is not only lying, violating my copyright, slandering, posting defamation etc. here on Wikipedia harming Genseiryu and myself etc. but he does so with dedicated pages in my name on his own homepage and other sites on the Internet. Keeping up with Mario Roering and posting complaints and requests for removal of content on sites such as YouTube, free webhosting etc. is a full time job. Mario Roering has absolutely no just cause for doing what he does, and his involvement here at Wikipedia is no different from his exploiting every other possible way on the Internet to slander me. On the contrary. That is why I do not need anymore crap from anyone, and perhaps I do tend to sort people a little too fast, even though their actions may not have been ill intended, but perhaps the last situation illustrates quite well exactly why I tend to do that? Another good example is when both Mario Roering and I were blocked a few weeks back, Mario Roering was unblocked just an instant later, but I was not, even though we posted the exact same reasons for requesting the unblock. Ever since 2005, when all this started, Mario Roering's candy-talking, deceits and lies have won him favors here on Wikipedia from the admins and others. The last action from NeilN would in my best opinion constitute yet another one such favor. I have never ever postulated, that these favors were done or initiated on purpose, but I have, and I still do claim, that lack of interest for fairness, facts and true intentions, makes this kind of manipulation by Mario Roering possible. And it should not be possible. EVERYONE should be equal to rules and regulations, but for Mario Roering, on mcuh more than one occasion, that has indeed not been the case. Mario Roering has been able to continue his deceitful and ill intended ways on Wikipedia for almost 5 years now. When will it ever stop? As long as it is this easy for Mario Roering to manipulate everyone he wants to, I cannot see the end of it. Even though I still believe that Mario Roering was using NeilN, and that NeilN did indeed jump the gun here siding with one party, instead of issuing equal consequences for both, I will let this one go and """"reset"""" the system. But what I have written here, should be taken into account and something serious should be done about Mario Roering's methods and ways.   """,0

 Enraging Changes and Hyper-Hyphenitis!

 removing aircrash investigation additions and calling them spam en third class publications 

Someone (AndyTheGrump)is accusing me of putting information about aircraft investigations as third class spam mail on wikipedia. This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so """"blessed"""" as Americans.  You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us, we are simply acting on requests of the industry. You are apparently some kind of Johnny the Selfkicker.

No, the statement is accurate. It's a verfiable fact (for which there's no shortage of evidence) that there are no pro-ID peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals. The only controversy is that created by the Discovery Institute's list, which you first posted here before deleting it.

Discovery Institute claims there are peer reviewed ID articles. But the DI's list has been long debunked:  It's also easily verifiable by searching the relevant scientific pub DBs.

92090,"On the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.

In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.

Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise. 

As for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article, as long as it continues to state that 'Cornwall is a county of Great Britain' or similar avoidance of the words 'county in England', new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to 'county in England' because rightly or wrongly, that's what everybody apart from a small minority (and as far as Wikipedia is concerned I think it's a minority of one), perceive it to be. 00:41 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)",0

:John Buster
A tag has been placed on John Buster, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add  on the top of John Buster and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from independent reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable.

 Your bold action is ignorant and incorrect. The """"C:"""" isn't just a logogram as you falsely assume and insist it is. Despite your arrogance and condescending tone with me, I'm going to place the proof on this talk page for the article as proof that the proper title of this game is indeed C: The Contra Adventure. For your information, just because an official website does not exist anymore for something, it does not give you the permission or right to change something about it and claim that it is valid. That is not how it works. I'll also post scans of the manual itself that supports what I state (and which applies to the other Contra games in the series whose titles lack colon only in the packaging). First off, here are the official, appropriate sources that list this game as C: The Contra Adventure:

http://ca.ign.com/articles/1998/09/17/c-the-contra-adventure

I would provide Appaloosa's old official website, but it is no longer functional. Same with the early Neo Contra official page.

Many of those links above indicate that the game has only received a North American release. And guess what? The wikipedia article itself even only lists a North American release date; because that is the only region where it has received an official release. Soon, I'm going to scan each page of the game's manual where its proper title is written (ie, every page that has it).

1.  Which parent and other relatives they most enjoy spending time with and which they resent.  (Enjoying to spend time with one's father and/or brother while despising one's Mother and/or sister, and the other way around).

2.  Which gender they are most accepted and which they are most rejected by.  (Friendship vs. Bullying)

3.  What activities they have access to and enjoy most.  (Ex:  Having little sports equipment to play with but lots of dolls vs. having a lot of sports equipment to play with but few dolls.)

4.  Some biological factors which form a sort of basis for everything else. (Ex: The brain develops more masculine or less masculine characteristics).

5.  Personal success vs. personal failure (Being more successful at an activity vs. failing at it would likely result in one enjoying or despising the activity and thus, be more or less inclined to do them).
And finally,

6.  The behaviors as a result of the above and how they affect what happens with them.  (Ex:  Acting more or less typical of gender role will affect how others react to you and in turn, how you react to them, further altering one's behavior and creating a sort of cycle.)

I also believe these factors affect how one reacts to the genders (accepting and rejecting stereotypes, as well what gender one prefers to spend time with) and even one's behavior in general but, that's another matter entirely.

Hi Werdna,someone correctly noted at WP:Requests for comment/May 2010 skin change/Bug reports#Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen that the preferences option """"Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen"""" doesn't actually do that. I notice that you changed the wording of that option one year ago, in rev:49553. Two questions:
 Was that requested or discussed anywhere, or more an ad-hoc wording and we can just tweak it to something like """"Widen the edit box to fill the available space""""?
 Why is that option in there in the first place? Seems to me that width:100% would be a good default for all installations, and site admins can just tweak it in their installations' CSS if they want.

Meetup

You may well have seen a site notice about the next Cambridge meetup, this Saturday 29 May. I thought those who have been in the past should have a personal invite, too.   

 What the hell? 

What the hell is """"It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions (like RfA) instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others"""" supposed to mean? I have virtually no involvement with RFA, and AFAIK am the single highest contributor of FAs to WP:LONDON; have you confused me with someone else?

As per my initial comments when the BM scheme was announced, I have serious reservations about creating formal ties between Wikipedia—whose prime selling point is editorial independence and a neutral point of view—and with any one museum, university or other institution. Quite aside from the glaring COI issue of an organisation paying people to promote their exhibits, nobody has even touched on the tax issues of paid editing being channelled (directly or indirectly) through the WMF. As you may know, I'm generally supportive of the idea of paid editing—I don't see how someone paid to promote an organisation differs from a fan of a band writing about said band, provided the COI is declared and the writer adheres to NPOV—but the talkpage of an almost moribund WikiProject is certainly not the place to unilaterally overturn what was a pretty overwhelming consensus at WP:Requests for comment/Paid editing. – scent 

 So you had serious and substantial reservations, and you decided to express them by making provocative comparisons? It's like the Wikipedia version of Godwin's Law.
 I've already made my own arguments about the importance of intent and outcome in """"paid editing"""", on the discussion page itself.  Saying that the British Museum is """"paying people to promote their exhibits"""", is at odds with the facts of this situation (as Liam has explained). I have no comment on """"tax issues"""", and consider that outside of the community's remit in any case — it can be dealt with by the Foundation, if indeed money is being """"channeled through"""" the latter. Your comments on circumventing community consensus have no relevance to me; if you'd like to make a big drama-fest out of somebody offering incentives to write featured-quality articles about notable historical artifacts, then I invite you to do so and see what response you get. —  • talk 

No, I had serious and substantial reservations, as did David Cane, and we listed them in great detail at the time the proposal was announced; to his extreme credit and unlike you, Liam paid the courtesy of answering them in detail rather than posting a rambling personal attack. (Still waiting for that explanation of what """"It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions (like RfA) instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others"""" is supposed to mean.)

But for the ref, links to images are seldom accessed anyway,so footnoting is perfectly proper and in line with wikipedia's manual of style. If the actual images can uploaded to commons, then I think adding one good historical image to the article is useful, but otherwise, they are awkward in the text.  I also have no beef with clarifying that they aren't precisely breeches, as they go to the ankle, except that no one has yet provided a dictionary definition or either term.

If too many others take the same tac WP will collapse into dross. You violate every rule in the book of which you accuse others. You are a mean spirited, very angry person that drives away editors with your sarcastic responses and general high-handed behavior. I suspect you have no real special knowledge of any of the articles upon which you squat like a vulture waiting tear apart others creative edits. You really need to crack a book and study up on a subject or two and find an article you feel needs rewriting and to straighten out the too turgid, redundant writing that exists here on WP. Stop trying to act like you are an administrator and grow up.

At a time when WP needs more editors, particularly female, you with your coarse, rude behavior is the last thing WP needs. You are, to summarize it, a net negative.

It was under Edward that a more Protestant character appeared, due to those who dominated his governemtn (edward was under age).  Of course under Mary the pendulum swung (violently) back the other way, and Elizabeth's position attemoted to reach a compromise.  To some extent that broke down under Charles I, and of course under the Commonwealtha presbyterian polity was adopted, but with the Restoration returned the bishops.

To all the vandals and so called just administrators, the air dates are minor problems, the facts and details surrounding Reeves suicided are not being written well enough, as everybody else is reporting, the fact that Reeves was to fight Moore next day, is also being reverted, this is pure vandalism. As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever, well, if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time, some spelling errors might occur, but it's not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia. And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts.""",1

How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation

 Note that valid questions I asked in regards to my citations were never answered by the contributor Mihaiam, who is the only person who has repeatedly removed my addition - and yet I am the one accused of having my version enforced - when it is Mihaiam repeatedly removing my contributions.  The first sentence regarding the Copenhagen Interpretation was present before I made redactions to the article - and has also been repeatedly removed by Mihaiam - therefore it is not even my additions Mihaiam is insisting upon, it is his own version.  This is not consensus, it is Mihaiam insisting he be the only contributor.

I find it interesting that this first original sentence was removed by Mihaiam (that was not even my inclusion) along with the additional clause I included with solid citations and references (including links to other Wikipedia Pages with almost exact quotes) regarding the Von Neumann Interpretation - as an adjunct to the Copenhagen Intepretation - both of which are well established in Quantum Physics and is very much related to Quantum Entanglement.  The two Interpretations included are the most prominent Interpretations of the Measurement problem at this time, therefore Mihaiam specious argument that it provides undue weight is also a straw man argument.

Consensus means I also have a right to provide my contributions.  Currently I am blocked out from editing.  So what is next.  How does one enter fair arbitration where someone looks at the references and citation I have made in good faith and an equitable decision is made - not just Mihaiam who has not answered my repeated requests asking why he thought my references were invalid - which is not a free discussion or an attempt at achieving consensus in good faith (and yet I am being blamed here.)

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",1

Just how many sticks of dynamite would need to go off inside your thick head before you get it? Trying to dismiss the WBO is piss weak. It's been on par with the other 3 for years. Check the record of wbo champions in unification fights.

This is the last time I'm explaining it, so read carefully. When Jones-Johnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion - Michalczewski. Jones & Johnson's belts meant NOTHING....PAPER titles. As well as being linear champion, Michalczewski & was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBA/IBF belts anyways. He never lost them in the ring. He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT.

Jones had only won a """"vacant interim"""" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder.

If you might fall into one or more of those categories and still think it necessary to pass comment here then please try to find an admin to do that for you (and if you are an admin - Chillum comes to mind - then find another).

I'd be pleased if the time that you would have spent here is expended instead on editing India-related articles. But bear in mind that you will need to be able to:

deal knowledgeably with touchy and repetitively-raised issues such as Hindutva-, religious- and caste-related POV-pushing
handle completely clueless newbies on a large scale, many of them encouraged to edit by an ill-considered WMF initiative
handle often large-scale sock- and meat-farms, and masses of copyvio and BLP violations
take copious amounts of general abuse pretty much daily
face all sorts of physical and legal threats, both on- and off-wiki, as well as real-life stalking over prolonged periods by multiple people

All with little or no support from the WMF and large swathes of the community who are more interested in the never-ending tendentious discussion of """"meta"""" issues - among them policy, """"honor"""", and the creation of a Wikitopia - than actually improving content where it matters most.

And when you need a break from articles that relate to 20 per cent of the world's population and which suffer grossly from bias, systemic and otherwise, go chill by creating a GA or at least a B-class article more or less single-handed. Do all of this and you'll make me a very happy (and surprised) man. Do it for 130k-ish edits without getting blocked, on spurious grounds or otherwise, then you'll be really quite remarkable.

Alternative Judaism
Zain, I think that Alternative Judaism is a good place to put the disclaimer about other religious groups that claim they are Jews, but I do think it is worth looking at the links a bit further, since I think you might have misread some of them. Also, remember that there is a difference between claiming descent from the """"Israelites"""" and actually claiming to be practicing Judaism.  Here are the links you keep using to illustrate your points, and that you added to the article:

 Anglo-Israelism  Never claimed to be Jews, they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites.  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism. I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way.  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article.
 Christian Identity  Weird choice.  They hate Jews, look at the text of the article, where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil. Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism, nor are they Jews.
 Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity, or possibly Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article.
 Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article
 Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited
 Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians, not a current group.  This is like including Jews Harp in the list - it is a reference to a historical label, not a religion.
 Jews for Jesus  Already in the article that you edited
 Messianic Renewed Judaism  A minor subset of Messianic Judaism
 Lost Ten Tribes  Not a religion, but another good place to put these sort of links
 British-Israel-World Federation  See Anglo-Israelism

I am open to discussion on these, but do read through the article first.  Do you agree or disagree with these points? It would be good to get this resolved.

So here is the hilarious and somewhat tricky part. I bet Grockl really patted himself on the back for this one. Grockl cited """"Clinical Study and Literature Review of Nasal Irrigation"""" which, guess what, was authored by UCSD physicians. In this study, there is NO OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE that says pulsatile irrigation is more effective than other irrigation methods EXCEPT in the following reference: """"It has also been shown that pulsatile saline delivery is more effective in removing bacteria than delivery via bulb syringe."""" They then reference a particular study. Guess which one??? -)

""""The efficacy of various irrigation solutions in removing slime-producing Staphylococcus."""" written in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma. That's right folks: THE STUDY ABOUT REMOVING BACTERIA FROM IMPLANT SURFACES. Grockl, you tried so hard.

Hi, I am Mishae, I would like to know if the indefinite block of user You have no nipples was fair. I'm not an admin, but maybe it would have been better to put him under topic ban instead? Not to mention, your block came after a warning, after which he didn't edit that or any other article. I personally invited him to WikiProject Pornography after seeing his sandbox. Regards,  
Since all that user's edits were obvious vandalism, including the sandbox, and the username further suggests an intention not to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, this was a routine block (the kind that the template  is regularly used to deal with). Regards,   (Edgar181) 
O.K, but don't you need to give a user a last warning before you block him/her? Not to mention, in sandbox a user have a right to write what he wants as long as he is not attacking anyone and it doesn't get out.  
There is no requirement in the blocking policy for a """"last warning"""" before a user can be blocked. And there are other types of inappropriate content in a user's sandbox than just attacks on other users (and it doesn't matter if it """"gets out"""" or not either).    (Edgar181) 
O.K. By last warning I ment this. He wasn't attacking other users just writing nipples and You have no nipples (in the very end). Is it dumb? Yes. Either way, if he will get unblocked feel free to give me a ping, and I will sent him to adoption.  

Ironically, I'm unhappy that  was not indeffed, as they've only ever pushed their POV, and they've had enough warnings (edit-summary based, and one on their talk page), and a prior block, yet haven't contributed anything anywhere else.  (tell Luke off here) 
Thank you. )  (tell Luke off here) 
(ec) I guess I didn't realize that the disruptive edits at Coventry City F.C. were their entirely of contributions to Wikipedia.  Upon review, it's clear that all edits are disruptive and that this user has no intention of contributing constructively.  Therefore, I agree with you that an indefinite block would be more appropriate and I have modified the block accordingly.  Regards,    (Edgar181) 

 Article Feedback Tool update 

Hey Edgar181. I'm contacting you because you're involved in the Article Feedback Tool in some way, either as a previous newsletter recipient or as an active user of the system. As you might have heard, a user recently anonymously disabled the feedback tool on 2,000 pages.  We were unable to track or prevent this due to the lack of logging feature in AFT5.  We're deeply sorry for this, as we know that quite a few users found the software very useful, and were using it on their articles.

We've now re-released the software, with the addition of a logging feature and restrictions on the ability to disable. Obviously, we're not going to automatically re-enable it on each article—we don't want to create a situation where it was enabled by users who have now moved on, and feedback would sit there unattended—but if you're interested in enabling it for your articles, it's pretty simple to do. Just go to the article you want to enable it on, click the """"request feedback"""" link in the toolbox in the sidebar, and AFT5 will be enabled for that article.

Again, we're very sorry about this issue; hopefully it'll be smooth sailing after this ). If you have any questions, just drop them at the talkpage. Thanks!

Paleolithic Europeans seem to have been a homogenous population, possibly due to a population bottleneck (or near-extinction event) on the Iberian peninsula, where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation, and then expanded into Europe during the Mesolithic period

This is false. I cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that Palaeolithic Europe was genetically homogeneous. If there is one, it would require in-line citation. I think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves. The studies have, rather, shown that Mesolithic Europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion.

In this change, Mike Halterman says """"no need to go through redirects, the point of piped links is for them to go to the correct name"""".

Yes, I know, but as I cited above, the disambiguation guidelines appear to recommend having the DAB page link to the """"full"""" name rather than to directly to the real name.  Rome (disambiguation) links to Rome, Italy even though the real article is at Rome.

Now, maybe you're saying that as long as I needed a piped link to satisfy MoS:DAB#Piping exception #3
3.  Use piping to format or quote a portion of an article whose name consists of both a title and a clarifier; for instance Harvey (film), USS Adder (SS-3), or """"School"""" (song).
I might as well go directly to the """"right"""" page.

Note a later sentence in MoS:DAB:
This guidance to avoid piping means that a link to a redirect term will sometimes be preferred to a direct link, if the redirect term contains the disambiguation title and the redirect target does not.
That could be read two ways:  as a way to avoid piping, or as a preference for linking to the disambiguated name in preference to the ambiguous one.

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.
 
−TABTAB

The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.  
 
−TABTAB 

How come the Catholic removed this section in his words """"because it didn't appear to be criticism"""" is this a joke?  
−TAB
Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,1

Similarity to """"Boy Kings""""
Section on similarity between this book and The Boy Kings was deleted. The facts in question are easily verified. What was the reason for this deletion?
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

Re: the two flags: on notability, the book has received substantial media attention. See, for example, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323342404579081503189753492.html

In addition, the author himself is critically acclaimed (see his page).

On sources, Amazon is a credible source for the topic in question, the relative contents of two books. The Twitter sources are necessary given that 1. Twitter is the topic being discussed (specifically: discussions on Twitter about the book), and 2. the issue is new and has not yet been written about in mainstream publications. These sources can be improved as additional information and media coverage becomes available which is likely given the high profile of the author, the ongoing media attention to the book, and the fact that The Circle will soon be released.
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

If it's easily verified, it shouldn't be hard to find secondary sources to support it.   

Agreed, that is a fair point, though it will only be easy to do so if sufficient time has passed for secondary sources to pick up on it which they haven't yet. It was only a matter of hours ago that the alleged victim of plagiarism was made aware of the details of the book in question (The Circle) and therefore able to point out the similarities. In the coming days it is likely to receive more attention. The female author in question has upward of 1,500 Twitter followers and a well-received book on Amazon and the other comments on Twitter corroborating her interpretation also come from prominent Tweeters. While I am a Wikipedia novice, it does not seem that this is an unusually suspect story to report in somewhat-real-time versus other pages that are rapidly updated, and to reiterate, it is very obvious from reading the respective Amazon pages that there are myriad similarities between the books and it is only a matter of time before this is picked up.
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

Update: a secondary source is now available. Updating accordingly. 
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

I see your edit was removed by a bot. I don't think it's impossible that there might surface secondary sources to support this part of the article, but these aren't them. Tweets are generally considered unsuitable, which is why bots remove them. And that Medium post isn't a suitable source either. 1) it's written by the person who is theoretically the aggrieved party in this case, 2) Medium is basically a self-publishing platform, like Livejournal, and doesn't really qualify as a secondary source, especially in the case of a potentially contentious allegation like this.   

Let's not let this plagiarism flap stand in the way of making this a better article.  It could use a lot of improvement.  My personal opinion is that the plagiarism claim (which amounts to """"I wrote a book about a woman hired by a social networking firm, and any similar books are plagiarism"""") should not be included in the article anyway, in the absence of a lawsuit or settlement.

The outlines aren't complete, but they are complete enough to be useful to readers.  And what good is a table of contents hidden in the back?  Tables of contents are most useful in the front.

The hatnote issue is very similar to adding the """"Contents"""" link to the sidebar.  And you opposed that too, on the grounds that the system wasn't ready to be displayed.

Shenme captured the essence of the situation very well:

A 'normal' wiki usually doesn't have a core structure, and so people don't expect it, but Wikipedia has quite a lot of material, and various ways of organizing it.  Having a link in the sidebar to the contents page will help people to discover what organization there is.  (whether perfect or not a separate topic).  And, actually, pointing people to the contents page and getting their resulting comments will improve the page.  Don't wait for the improvements first...  

The OOK needs editors for each of its pages, and for the essential pages it's missing.  Relying on a small team to finish all of this will take decades. (Do the math).  I've been on this project for almost 4 years already!

So, if hatnotes will benefit readers while attracting editors to these pages, then that looks like a pretty damn good solution to me.

Amazingly, Mlpearc boasts on his Talk page or Wiki internal bio he's a high school drop out but DOES have his GED! I suspect there is a LOT of professional rivalry...in Mlpearc's mind, not in the opinion of Wiki editors who way back in 2011 decided to KEEP my Wiki bio because Wiki DOES think I'm notable.

Mlpearc's comment above about still believing I'm a nobody doesn't rankle me. If there is ONE thing I am NOT insecure about it's my resume and other credentials. But Mlpearc's opinion that I'm not notable sounds rude to me.

Anybody else agree?

You used this non-sequitur as your basis for reversion.  And to this day you are persisting in it.  Yet again another example of a huge logic disconnect that permeates this entire exchange.

As for the meta-discussion (the discussion about the discussion), Andy's revert was based upon his assessment that the issue needed to be discussed before such a change could be accepted.  And where did he choose to raise that discussion?  Over on my User Talk page.  That is the most inappropriate place to have such a discussion.  I suggested to him that the discussion be moved here.

In the end the comment I posted (which was aimed primarily at 'PST') seemed to totally summarise the situation. ie that somebody might benefit in pulling their head out of their ass. A ridiculous response to a ridiculous situation. It was meant as a joke, albeit insulting.
In the same spirit of humour I'd like to quote PST out of contextPerhaps I should have framed my remark in a less confrontational manner, but at its present length, it will at least leave an indelible mark on the OP's mind, which, I hope, will help him/her to realize the meaning of my comment later on.

 A blog post I think is important 
First, I appreciate the notes that were left recently, and the ones left during the February drama.  I will probably be back, but not like I was before.  I love Wikimedia and everything it is trying to do.  I wanted to be a part of it.  More, I wanted to show its potential.  The worst misconception about me is that I am arrogant about my work.  I most want people to realize that everything I did, they can do too.  You don't even need to do what I did; your own secret hopes and ambitions on here have the potential to succeed.  

It's not self-promotion.  If you are contributing work of such high quality that you could actually make a career for yourself, then Wikipedia is damn lucky to have you.  If what you give is crap, face it:  your stuff will be removed, nobody will stick up for you and you'll have zero hopes of ever branching beyond Wikipedia.  This is important:  you should strive to contribute material that is of such high quality people actually think you could be a professional (but the ridiculous argument that you are using Wikipedia to doing that is stupid beyond belief).  

I outlined on my blog how I went about doing what I did on here, how you could replicate it if you wanted, and general advice.  I don't care if anyone follows it.  But I certainly hope it explains how unexceptional my contributions were; that is, if only other people attempted what I did.  

I'm an artist - I wanted to work on here and give something back.  But I never wish to be a professional photographer or journalist/reporter.  I realize that's a shock for many to believe.  Wikipedia is a great public space to attempt art, whether it be journalism and information as art, or photography that is encyclopedic before it is artistic.  

Here's the blog post where I try to explain how I succeeded to gain access, improved my photography and made a reputation for myself simply for doing what I believed in on Wikipedia:  blog.shankbone.org/2008/07/19/david-shankbone-finally-tells-you-how-to-replicate-his-success.aspx

If contributing high quality work that is recognized on and off Wikipedia is self-promotion, then we need more self-promoters who try to create such high quality.

After reviewing the deletion, I think the error is technical.  I am on a Hughes Sat network that uses transparent proxies.  This was causing me to log in and out from page to page.  The original article which was not the correct article went through and posted when I switched to SSL wiki server.  This was unexpected, and as I was editing the article to the correct format it was deleted. (roughly 60-90 seconds from the originally post)   Due to this technical error the correct post was never entered into wiki.

This would have been the correct post if the article had not been deleting during editing and if I had not had technical issues which inadvertly caused me to post the incorrect format of the article.

Hey, I wasn't intending to be rude but ironic. Concepts of irony differ between concepts of ironic (most users of British English and Hiberno-English claim that Americans don't do irony - which was why some modern US comedy shows have shocked Europeans by showing that some members do indeed do irony.) Hiberno-English, which I speak and write, is heavily ironic and tongue-in-cheek. That comment was intended in that way. I understand Ed's desire for uniformity and indeed share it. I have been creating formats and styles since I came here. My only point is that when someone finds a better way of doing things we shouldn't adopt a mantra of 'Against the rules. Against the rules' but be willing to say 'that's a better way. Lets see how we can turn it from a once-off into something with a wider usage'. Maybe we should allow a number of variations on the master template, and so allow users to opt for one. Or create a specific template for religious leaders (say Gerald's one), and allow variations for other categories. I'm sorry if my sarcasm was mis-interpreted. It is just a feature of hiberno-english, what is sometimes called (tongue-in-cheek) Irish bitchiness.  21:42, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)""",0

Which of the places on the list are notable enough for separate articles (if they don't have one now)?  I've added links to articles where I could them.  I'd say articles are also needed at least for Sugar Creek,  Red Butte, Rocky Ridge, Echo Canyon, and Emigration Canyon.  A couple of points of interest that could be added are Genoa, Nebraska (settled by the Latter-day Saints as a supply point) and This Is The Place Heritage Park.  I'm sure other landmarks will be identified with additional research.
Which places could be reasonably combined in sections, like the eastern Wyoming sites? Some suggested sections:  Iowa (mostly covering the 1840s); the Missouri River area (Winter Quarters / Kanesville / Florence); Missouri River to Fort Laramie; For Laramie to Fort Bridger (with a focus on the handcart companies); and Fort Bridger to Salt Lake Valley.  The Iowa section could include a brief subsection on the route used by the handcart companies from Iowa City to Florence.
And how are we to deal with elapsed time, as early companies had different experiences than later companies?  One chunk for geography and another for linear time? I think the organization of the Mormon Trail article should focus on geography.  Content that is intrinsically chronological could be moved to the Mormon Pioneer article.  Would it make sense to tackle both of these articles at once to try to ensure that they compliment each other without simply being repetitive?—",0

Freud's ideas are certainly much discussed today, and I would be the first to agree that they must be grappled with and dealt with seriously, if only because of their currency.  So Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia.  I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today.  The existing article is quite thorough on """"A"""" and had almost nothing on """"B"""".  A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology.  

Let's compare them:  Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegial collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration.  Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data.  As far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet  ), and I don't know anything about Maslow.  Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong.  I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic.  Of course, I am striving for NPOV.  Do you really feel that presenting Freud's pseudoscience without comment is NPOV, whereas quoting one of many eminent critics is not?   21:55, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)""",0

 One MO' time for the kids in the back... 

JUST can’t let go of a few items, huh?

Okay from the top:
1) My info on the GLAAD awards and the EISNER Nominations came from Winick’s website. BUT is that’s not good enough…

2)  I did a quick GOOGLE ( WINICK and GLAAD AWARDS) and found various articles to that effect. Here’s one that mention awards from 2001 & 2002

http://www.psicofxp.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-105929.html

here’s the link to the GLAAD awards in 2003 ( they don’t archive back further then that)

http://www.glaad.org/media/release_detail.php?id=3393&PHPSESSID;=84e84fd40ccf1d3ee7499d7ff630ca43
 
and a photo from 2003

http://www.glaad.org/publications/resource_doc_detail.php?id=3396&PHPSESSID;=84e84fd40ccf1d3ee7499d7ff630ca43

3) the Eisners was more difficult because were too many sites and not a definitive archive. I punched in """"Winick and Eisner awards"""" into GOOGLE and got over 500 hits. Some mention his nominations in articles ABOUT him, some site specific years in articles ABOUT the Eisner nominations. It doesn’t look like his website is lying…

Now, onto some specific comments:

""""Furthermore, I saw the article more pro-gay than anti-gay. I think the previous version of the article attempts to put Judd in a rather """"heroic"""" role by saying that he pushed boundaries and was willing to shrug off industry standards to get his point across. It may have had a POV issue, but I don't think that it was homophobic. I would be careful about throwing that word around, being that you are suggesting unbiased claims. Practice what you preach, and all that.""""

Forgive me jumping the gun on mentioning """"homophobia"""", but the article REALLY didn’t read as positive or heroic when: 
1) It focussed  –almost ENTIRELY—on the issue of Winick writing about gays.
 
2)Tossed some interpretation that he made Robin( of Batman and Robin) into a crossdresser ( which he didn’t. it was JOKE. It’d be like accusing MONTY PYTHON of promoting """" lifestyle choices"""" by having them dress as women all the time)

3)Adding/allowing an erroneous comment from another comic book creator. (MIKE Miller, later changed into the a false statement by FRANK Miller)

4) And lastly, make mention of """" gay groups"""" who took issue with, disagreed with, etc, Mr. Winick’s portrayal of gays. No evidence t that fact was given and it appears that the VAST majority of the gay community doesn’t have a problem with him.

All of THIS, didn’t really come off as an endorsement, a slap on the back, or in much of ANY way that he was being applauded for making a stand.

""""I would add two points: (1) The article should definitely include some discussion, albeit NPOV, of Winick's penchant for gay characters. He has consistently used his writing to present gay characters and homosexual issues to young readers. He hasn't made a secret of that, either. The article should be neutral, but that fact is a critical facet of Winick's career. """"

I don’t agree. It COVERS the issue already. You’re asking for an opinion. I’ve been told, several times, that THAT isn’t the point of this site.

Also, """"Winick's penchant for gay characters"""". Why JUST talk about gays? I mean, is it because  he get PRESS about them?  He’s got LOTS of other people in his comics. But if you’re mentioning GAYS because it’s gotten media coverage, then THAT is already IN the article. No need to expand on it.

""""He has consistently used his writing to present gay characters and homosexual issues to young readers. He hasn't made a secret of that, either.""""

1) What’s all this stuff about YOUNG readers? Comics, and even his book were aimed at ALL readers? Are you trying to slide in a sideways comment that Winick is targeting children? And secondly, in the 3 times I’ve heard Winick talk about this subject he always comes back to the point that he includes ALL types of people in his stories. Diversity is the goal.

In general you seem VERY intent on shining a different light on this issue. One that falls into opinion and editorializing.
 The facts are covered. It’s there. It’s done.

(2) He is not considered """"one of the top writers"""" in comics. Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, Jeph Loeb...there are plenty of names at the top, but Winick's has never been among them. I've never read a claim otherwise, either  so if this article is going to allege Winick's prominence, you'd better include some sort of citation. 

Well, 1) It doesn’t say he’s the MOST prominent writer in comics like a Frank  Miller, Neil Gaiman,  Grant Morrison or an Alan Moore. It’s says ONE of the top writers.
To that fact, He’s one of only about 30 writers signed exclusively, he writes top titl",0

What's the matter with you, wikipedia lovers? Are you robots or something? Is that all you do all day? Wikipedia seems to have taken control of your lives. I bet this post will be reverted using Huggle or Twinkle or something like that, or you'll issue me a stern warning not to make unconstructive edits to the pive pillars of wikipedia, or you'll just block me.

Hello Ckatz. I noticed that you deleted my link from the External Links section of the wikipedia entry on Salt Spring Island. I am curious as to why you did this as it is the most valuable online resource pertaining to Salt Spring Island that is available. The only searchable clickable street index for one thing,and also the map is the only source for info pertaining to hiking trails, routes and trailheads on Salt Spring Island. The map found at http://www.mapofsaltspring.com/mapofsaltspring.pdf is, in fact, the most encycopedic source of info pertaining to avian and marine life in and around the island also.

Peer Review

As others have mentioned above, the tone doesn't seem to be encyclopedia-like, its more of an educational piece on what happened from your view.  In the opening section you write """"This operation was the result of wary parents under the newly instated Castro Regime who did not want to give up their parental rights to the Cuban government. Largely unpublicized for fear of being viewed as political propaganda, this underground operation eventually became the largest recorded exodus of unaccompanied youth in the Western hemisphere."""" That is a very hard claim to substantiate without any sort of reference. The whole Demographics of Minors section could either be put in another section or completely deleted, because earlier you already state the children were Cuban, and their parents didn't agree with Castro, so it is in my belief their religion's and social status don't matter enough for its own section.- eo""",0

Obviously, I know they don't all follow the same rules, but the rules they both follow, the follow equally. Yes, the lead section should clarify what a list includes, but a lead section of a regular article should also clarify what is included in the rest of that. I didn't mean that lists and articles are exactly the same and should be treated the same, but with regards to the Lead, it must do the same thing.
For a list of US presidents, I believe you have to say what the US president is, not necessarily his constitutional duties, but what it means to be President, what the position is, to provide context for the reader. I would also say how many there have been, who was the first, and who is the current. I may also include other information, such as how long a person is President for (a term of four years) and then maybe say who has held consecutive terms, who has held office more than once (separately), who has died while in office. An overview of the presidents, not what the president does. That's just off the top of my very head, at 2.30am, mind you.
No, plot summaries should not be included in a list of episodes (unless there are no season articles). FYI, I have written 8 episodic Featured lists (List of Degrassi: The Next Generation episodes and each season of that series) and 3 other Featured lists (Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office, List of Scripps National Spelling Bee champions and List of Blue Peter presenters, as well as two Featured articles related to TV series (Degrassi: The Next Generation and Mother and Child Reunion), as well as the Leads for the FLC List of 7th Heaven episodes and former FL List of The Sopranos episodes. 
While I may not be expressing myself as well as I might at 10am, I do know the different between a list and an article, and am not suggesting that any old information is stuck in there to bulk it out, but also, a little more than simply """"Avatar: The Last Airbender is a 61-episode Emmy award-winning American animated television series written and created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. It aired from February, 2005 to July, 2008."""" I would say how many seasons, whether the episodes have been released on DVD, or any other new media outlets such as iTunes or something.

PROPOSED ADDITION:

Because interracial rape is now overwhelmingly black on white, it has become difficult to do research on it or to find relevant statistics. The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime, but the way it presents rape data obscures the racial element rather than clarifies it. Dr. William Wilbanks, a criminologist at Florida International University, had to sift carefully through the data to find that in 1988 there were 9,406 cases of black-on-white rape and fewer than ten cases of white-on-black rape.

This RS question is whether Stephen Hill, the cofounder of a notable niche music genre, """"spacemusic"""", can be disqualified as a secondary source expert, and have his radio production company's website (= expert's book) reclassified with primary source usage restrictions (results in removal). 

The radio production company is Hearts of Space established 25 years ago (35 including the original Music From the Hearts of Space show on KPFA). HoS was historically played on more than 250 USA public radio stations on a scale of 500. This 2004-01-11 San Francisco Chronicle description of Stephen Hill's expertise reads: 
""""Hill, who coined the term """"spacemusic"""" more than 20 years ago, hosts the """"Music From the Hearts of Space"""" music program, syndicated on 250 National Public Radio stations, including San Francisco's KALW 91.7 FM, which airs two hours of the program at 10 p.m. Sundays. In addition, Hill's Hearts of Space Web site (www.hos.com) provides streaming access to an archive of hundreds of hours of spacemusic artfully blended into one-hour programs combining ambient, electronic, world, New Age and classical music.""""

The claim as I understand it (maybe I don't), is that a justified primary source reclassification, along with other sources properly reclassified as primary, would cause a synthesis/OR violation in the article titled Space music. The further result would be that the cofounder's detailed analysis, opinions, and other website information would be mostly removed from the article about the genre he cofounded. 

The campaigning editor says his most contentious objection is that the name of the genre is a """"commercial entity's branding drive"""". Presumably, he objects strongly to a previously unnoticed form of commercial spam in the Wikipedia article, and a great wrong should be righted by minimizing it. If I correctly understand it, I can only describe this position as extremist. 

Spacemusic genre is a case of limited circle fame. Its current USA public radio fans are thinly scattered, but dedicated to its support through public radio fund drives. Its niche music sales amount to less than 1% of the commercial market, so very little is written about spacemusic in major USA music publications dependent on commercial advertising. 

(The rest of the 102 Space music sources to be considered for reclassification as primary, and then removed for synthesis/OR, should be handled separately to avoid noticeboard overload.) 
 

 I suppose all this would give some reason for caution in using these sources, and particularly a reason to be careful to try to double-source things and to give all sides where sources disagree, but it sounds to me like Hill would be a perfectly reasonable source. Where he is writing about his own work in fostering the genre, or about his own show, he's primary. Where he's writing about the musicians in the genre, it would seem to me that he is secondary, just like any music critic. -  | Talk 

I agree with  on all three points - multiple sources are always recommended when there are differing published views on a topic.  On the primary/secondary question - Hill would be a primary source when writing about himself and his own radio show. On third-party topics such as music styles, record albums, musicians, the radio and music business, etc, he'd be a secondary source.   I'd say that within his area of expertise, there's no reason not to use his work as a reliable source.   

Just to be clear about the encyclopedia-margins deletionist effect of what you are both saying: 

Stephen Hill and his Hearts of Space website were previously treated as expert-based secondary sources via WP:V(WP:SPS). The Wikipedia art/music reasoning has previously been that the founder of an art/music genre knows subjectively more about what he/she created than anyone else as a matter of expert opinion. You are changing that.

What a secondary source says can be combined in a point-by-point source-provable editorial analysis. In this case, since there are so few other mainstream sources, many or most of them are presently combined with Hill's previous secondary source expertise to write the article.

But a primary source has fewer rights in an article than a secondary source. What a primary source says cannot be combined with other sources for a standard article editorial analysis, even if every point made by article editors can be proved through analysis of t",0

I have added the necessary qualification.  Regarding the original lead, it was a mess. Amongst other things the original lead had redundancies, it employed terms without first defining them or linking to a definition, sometimes the term """"compound"""" was used and other times """"statment"""" was used, the relatively minor matter of material implication vs. logical entailment was too long, used an awful example and just confused what preceded it.  In the lead it would have been sufficient to just say something like: """"The material conditional is to be distinguished from logical entailment (which is usually symbolosed using [double turnstile].""""  The distinction can then be detailed in the body of the article.  Also the failure to even mention propositional calculus  which is the context in which someone is most likely to look up the meaning of the operator  was an unacceptable omission.  By the time someone reaches the study of paraconsistent logical systems they will likely have no need to look up what a material conditional is on Wikipedia.

His own words don't suffice here, and a source pointing out similarities and asserting in a totally non-objective (try putting """"Bill O'Reilly's bullying media-age demagoguery"""" into the article and see what you get) way is not enough to include the comparison.   (Karwynn) """,0

I don't buy those arguments.

First, there has also been a recent trend of creating a season article for every Division I program for each of the last 3 or so seasons. I see no reason that that trend won't start to backtrack into earlier teams. Pages getting deleted have less to do with the notion of a single-season article being inherently non-notable, than it has to do with those specific articles not being up to standards. Just look at all the single-season Nebraska football articles that are being created and kept. You say, """"There will never be a separate article for any of these pre-2000 Gators football teams."""" That's a rather bold proclamation to issue on behalf of all editors, present and future. Never say never.

I don't buy that you need to bypass the redirect to take the reader to the applicable section. That's why the season redirects typically redirect to the correct section in the target article. Even better, in case the sections get renamed, only the redirect will need to have its link tweaked, rather than the set of all articles that bypassed the redirect.

Just because there is only one single season article between 1906 and 1999 right now, it does not preclude the distinct possibility of there being more. Especially when many of those 1990's squads finished in the top 10, and the 1995 team actually played in the national championship game - how is that not notable?

Merging the decade articles is a fine consensus. I'm in no way countering that. However, consensus can change over time, and there is no need to prevent other articles from linking to new Florida season articles should that situation ever arise.

I don't know why you bring in broken links, unless you're suggesting that the decade articles would be deleted, and that somehow the bot could figure out to point the link at the season article at that point. Why not keep it simple, and leave the link to the redirect. That way, there is no need for this magic bot. That's one of the main features of redirects: to serve as a placeholder for a possible future article distinct from the redirect target. You call my arguments specious, yet I'm not the one trying to justify departure from accepted Wikipedia guidelines.

True, the answer is obvious. Have the redirect point at the correct section of the decade article. Simple as that. I'll even help update the redirect targets. FaultRyan """,0

Can you expand on the install instructions?  I did not add it to 'User:myname/vector.js', but instead 'User:myname/common.js'.  This didn't exist before I created it.

Also why have the vector skin check at the end if it is added to the skin javascript directly?  I just realized I added it to global first, and the check did work.  Moving it over to vector.js now...

I fumbled through but expanded instructions may help others.

Also, the shortcut key does not work to un-hide on Macs.  Not that I want to unhide it...
I could not figure out what to edit in the code to change the shortcut keys.

It also loads after all of the page content, is there a way to load it before so the sidebar doesn't appear then disappear, or edit the skin directly?

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1

 UPDATE 

I don't have time for another long post, but I would like to share a site that you can use.  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/shilohshepherd.htm

This site also includes 

ARBA = American Rare Breed Association
APRI = American Pet Registry Inc.
NKC = National Kennel Club

However, my research has proven that many other """"registries"""" are also selling papers for Shiloh Shepherds!!  These include, but are not limited to .....

Other All-Breed Registries: 

The following is a list of some of the other all-breed registries in existence in North America — Caution should be exercised when dealing with a breeder who registers with any of these registries, especially when the breed is recognized by any of the major all-breed registries listed above. Many breeders use these registries because they are not able to meet the more demanding requirements of the CKC, AKC, or UKC. 

The information shown in quotations was taken directly from the registry's web site and speaks for itself as to the goals of some of these registries. 

American Canine Association (ACA) — """"America's largest veterinary health tracking purebred canine registry."""" — Note: In the """"Find A Puppy"""" section of their website, dog/puppy seekers are referred to pet/retail stores. Very little information is available on the website regarding their goals or mission as a registry. 

American Purebred Registry (APR) — The APR issues registration certificates for dogs and cats. They start a pedigree file with the information the owner sends them. Once APR accepts an application, a registration certificate is issued and the animal is considered registered. APR is a record keeping agency only and does not sponsor dog shows, field trials or competitions of any kind. On the application, the owner certifies that the dog or cat is a purebred representative of the breed. They take the owner's word for it and no proof is required. 

America's Pet Registry Inc. (APRI) — """"An internationally recognized association of responsible pet owners, breeders, distributors, veterinarians, retailers, pet product manufacturers, and other concerned parties dedicated to the humane care of animals, the preservation of quality bloodlines, and the individual's right of pet ownership."""" APRI recently re-incorporated as a for-profit corporation. — The APRI promotes and encourages the sale of dogs and cats through distributors and retailers. """"America's Pet Registry, Inc. was begun as insurance for the pet industry..."""" """"APRI offers free dual registrations on dogs from reputable registration services to professional breeders. We classify a professional breeder as one who has three or more breeding females and who regularly sells puppies in the pet market."""" 

Animal Registry Unlimited (ARU) — Some statements found on the opening page of their website: """"We register all pets and animals."""" """"We guarantee that your pet or animal can be registered with us."""" """"Providing a registry for the development of new breeds of useful pets and animals. Unlike many organizations we encourage the development of new breeds."""" 

Continental Kennel Club (CKC) — Note: This registry is also known as the CKC and should not be confused with the Canadian Kennel Club — These are two completely separate registries.) — The Continental Kennel Club recognizes 450 breeds as purebred. The Continental Kennel Club has a section known as """"Miscellaneous Breed Registration"""" which allows for the crossing of two purebred parents of different breed types to produce hybrid puppies. Registered as MISC/BREED1-BREED2 and isolated from purebred registrations, they are distinguished from other breeds on registration certificates by having """"non-purebred"""" printed on their registration certificates. In addition, the Continental Kennel Club has a section within their club for developing new breeds. Stock used for these breeding programs is listed in the """"Development Class"""". The Continental Kennel Club has implemented a classified section on their site where club members can advertise their breeds. If you have a look at some of the more popular breeds such as the Cocker Spaniel, some of the kennels advertising there include breeders of cock-a-poos and other crosses. The Continental Kennel Club's website provides very little information regarding their goals or mission as a registry. For more information, however, there is a very thorough web page at: Continental Kennel Club FAQ.

Hi Kryzstof, greetings to you and thank you for your invitation to feel free to ask you about any clarifications about Wikipedia. I would like to ask you how can I (or some administrator) change back the wrong presentation of the South Slavic languages and dialects division, placed in the chart, which is placed in the right side of the articles about Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Bunjevac and Serbo-Croatian language? 
In the chart named 'Chart of South Slavic languages and dialects' someone has changed the basically known fact that the politically created standards of the SerboCroatian language, such as Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Bunjevac, etc., they all belong to the Central South Slavic languages, and they don't belong in the same group with Slovenian language (which is Western group of South Slavic Languages). Please if you can, help me correct back this factual state of the things in this chart, because like it is now - it gives a wrong information to the readers. It should be like it was before,-showing: Serbian, Croatian, Bunjevac, and Bosnian in the SAME group of dialects, and that group is CENTRAL South Slavic Diasystem. Thanks;

You'll just have to forgive me if I take a timeout for a Kafka moment. From """"Before the Law"""":
BEFORE THE LAW stands a doorkeeper. To this doorkeeper there comes a man from the country and prays for admittance to the Law. But the doorkeeper says that he cannot grant admittance at the moment. The man thinks it over and then asks if he will be allowed in later. """"It is possible,"""" says the doorkeeper, """"but not at the moment."""" Since the gate stands open, as usual, and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man stoops to peer through the gateway into the interior. Observing that, the doorkeeper laughs and says: """"If you are so drawn to it, 'just try to go in despite my veto. But take note: I am powerful. And I am only the least of the doorkeepers. From hall to hall there is one doorkeeper after another, each more powerful than the last. The third doorkeeper is already so terrible that even I cannot bear to look at him."""" These are difficulties the man from the country has not expected; the Law, he thinks, should surely be accessible at all times and to everyone, but as he now takes a closer look at the doorkeeper in his fur coat, with his big sharp nose and long, thin, black Tartar beard, he decides that it is better to wait until he gets permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at one side of the door. There he sits for days and years. He makes many attempts to be admitted, and wearies the doorkeeper by his importunity. The doorkeeper frequently has little interviews with him, asking him questions about his home and many other things, but the questions are put indifferently, as great lords put them, and always finish with the statement that he cannot be let in yet. The man, who has furnished himself with many things for his journey, sacrifices all he has, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. The doorkeeper accepts everything, but always with the remark: """"I am only taking it to keep you from thinking you have omitted anything."""" During these many years the man fixes his attention almost continuously on the doorkeeper. He forgets the other doorkeepers, and this first one seems to him the sole obstacle preventing access to the Law. He curses his bad luck, in his early years boldly and loudly; later, as he grows old, he only grumbles to himself. He becomes childish, and since in his yearlong contemplation of the doorkeeper he has come to know even the fleas in his fur collar, he begs the fleas as well to help him and to change the doorkeeper's mind. At length his eyesight begins to fail, and he does not know whether the world is really darker or whether his eyes are only deceiving him. Yet in his darkness he is now aware of a radiance that streams inextinguishably from the gateway of the Law. Now he has not very long to live. Before he dies, all his experiences in these long years gather themselves in his head to one point, a question he has not yet asked the doorkeeper. He waves him nearer, since he can no longer raise his stiffening body. The doorkeeper has to bend low toward him, for the difference in height between them has altered much to the man's disadvantage. """"What do you want to know now?"""" asks the doorkeeper; """"you are insatiable."""" """"Everyone strives to reach the Law,"""" says the man, """"so how does it happen that for all these many years no one but myself has ever begged for admittance?"""" The doorkeeper recognizes that the man has reached his end, and, to let his failing senses catch the words, roars in his ear: """"No one else could ever be admitted here, since this gate was made only for you. I am now going to shut it.""""

Poor merging of planned films into the main list of films, because trying to sort by """"Story Order"""" screws up the table badly
""""Reception"""" was stolen wholesale from Star Wars; this redundancy is unnecessary, and the section can be linked to in the """"See also"""" section

Welcome to Wikipedia, !  My name is Ryan, aka . I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use HTML and CSS. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:

How to edit a page
Editing, policy, conduct, and structure tutorial
Picture tutorial
How to write a great article

There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my talk page. Please be sure to sign your name on Talk Pages using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right? )

I hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day.
Sincerely, . 06:42, August 2, 2005 (UTC)",0

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

said he had made a dumb remark... an innocent and in that case accurate remark

Hi, Oda Mari. Long time no see. I hope all is well with you and that you're having fun editing. I've stopped editing here and moved over to a Japanese film-specific wiki. (There are several reasons for my departure. The main one is that I believe, Wikipedia's """"notability"""" criteria makes all non-English, non-mainstream film articles easy targets for deletion, unless they have been extensively written about in English.) Unfortunately, so far, the editors only consist of a native English-speaker (myself), and (I believe) a native Czech-speaker. So, with no native Japanese-speaker, we sometimes have to wrestle with the Japanese language a bit ;-) A question has come up at:

 Mind Pollution and Sin Star votes 

I have to take issue with your count in closing the vote on Mind Pollution. By my count there were, as you said, five votes for deletion — from myself (the nominator), BDAbramson, Mgm, KissL, and DV8 2XL — and only two votes to keep — one from Factitious, and four from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I also disagree with your count of votes for the related article, Sin Star. By my count there were five delete votes — the same five who voted to delete Mind Pollution — but you only counted four, one merge vote from Factitious, and three keep votes from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I would suggest that in the future when closing votes you check the history to determine the authorship of unsigned votes. I also think the quality and nature of the arguments presented are more important than the raw vote count. I would like to renominate these articles, but I'm not sure what the rules on that are. I guess I'll have to go read the deletion policy.

105343,"""I am not a sociologist but I know that this academic field is plagued with feminists.  I don't care what anyone's point of view is, but when they make up words like """"hypergyny"""" (which is only used by academic sociologists), the word should at least make common sense and be backed by evidence.  """"Hypergyny"""" fails on both counts.

""""In the U.S., women’s hypergynous tendencies allow higher status men to be functionally polygynous.""""

Why only in the US?  Not only in the US, and not only among humans, but generally, high status males reproduce more.

""""In some cultures, women are expected to marry a spouse who is more economically, socially, or politically powerful. Known as hypergyny, this practice is common in India.""""

This makes it sound odd for women to desire higher status men, while the truth is that this is essentially universal, just as it is universal that men prefer physically attractive women.

""""Though an expected social norm in America, hypergyny is slowly being replaced by isogamy, marriage between equals, and the marrying 'down' of woman. Many anthropologists ascribe this to increased gender equality between women and men.""""

This is pure nonsense.  As I pointed out, it is simply impossible for women on average to marry up.  No evidence is provided for the above statement because it is impossible for it to be true.  The above is simply a lie designed to make it sound like feminism in America has promoted equality, when nothing could be further from the truth.

My point of view, which probably does not belong in Wikipedia, is that feminism has caused American women to become sluts, having lots of sex with high status men outside of marriage and ignoring men of their own status.  I can also reference academic papers backing up this point of view.  If the section on """"hypergyny and isogamy"""" is to remain, then I should be free to add a section expressing my point of view.

  

Ah, here's the thing: You cannot edit Wikipedia based on """"what you know.""""  All content has to be drawn from reliable sources, which a scholarly journal certainly is.  Whether it's an academic term or not is irrelevant to whether it belongs in the article.  
Just as an aside, arguing against peer-reviewed published works on the use of the hypergyny concept on the basis that """"you know differently"""" is not going to work here. I do agree with you though that some better sources are necessary for the statements in the second paragraph.  

The only source sited in the whole section is a book review published on the web, not an academic paper with peer review.  This is hardly a reliable source.

If the term """"hypergyny"""" is going to be used, it should be made clear that it is an term of academic sociologists, and not a term in general use.  And there should be at least one reference to a truly reliable source containing the term.

I just noticed that the second paragraph of this section is a copy of a blog entry.

  

If someone wants to replace this text, there are numerous reliable sources that use the term hypergyny.  One of the sources I gave above would probably work.  We do agree, however, on the need for sources and the second paragraph, which fails WP:Vthough I'm pretty sure the blog took from Wikipedia, not the other way around.  I'm not really clear on why it matters whether JoeJohn Q. Public uses the term or not; it's not like we do this with articles relevant to physics, geology or biology.

I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.

In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.

As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.

Anyway, please correct me, I may be wrong too.

You page protected Amanda Knox.  The previous editor was redirecting it because they said the article was a copy of the murder article.  But the article has been up only 2 hours and already it has changes.  The previous editor before that was John Carter, who is an administrator.

What you should do is not to listen to the pro-redirect editor and let many editors improve the article so that it is not a copy of the murder article.  Then it can be judged on its own.  If people add biographical details to the murder article, those will probably be removed because they are unrelated to the murder.  So we are stunning the growth due to inflexible rules.

There is already a consensus, about 5 editors have edited the article and 1 changed it to a redirect and demanded page protection.  5:1 is consensus.  You should unprotect it and ask for opinions on the Amanda Knox talk page.  Then see what the real consensus is.

Germany and Austria have very limited protection for freedom of expression.  France is much the same, except that penalties tend to be less extreme.  England also has quite limited protection.  In fact, the concept """"freedom of speech"""" is barely understood, let alone respected, in Western Europe, despite much pretentious posturing.  And before Americans get on a high horse about it, they should bear in mind that a high level of legal protection was only reached in 1964, in a Supreme Court decision in a case involving Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement.

Speedy deletion of Elisabeth Rodriguez
 A tag has been placed on Elisabeth Rodriguez requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

However, yes, I have changed a few things around as a correction. It is not to offend anyone, but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD (the Green Hornet and Kato), I too have some historical points of views. I understand that you have been accused of being a pan-Indian nationalist, while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist. As far as Indian martial arts are concerned, martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the Indian martial arts section. Therefore, it effects both of us.

It seems like through this wiki-conflict, it has thrown us together into one pot. If I am here to put you or your culture down, or to discredit India, why in the first place would I have stuck up for you. I had not intentions in mind when I did that. It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message. Just like, for example, a few years ago, when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime. I was outraged...

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine both our knowledge to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.

At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.

Do you agree with me on this? If so, it would be nice if we could communicate via e-mail. I have more ideas to share with you. I believe we can make this work. As far as JFD is concerned, I do not know what his intentions are. Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project? or maybe I am wrong... Indrancroos

20783,"""

I've got to say, I've read you """"pacafistic"""" rules, seen your idea of """"logic"""", and have heard tales of your """"justification"""" and I just have to say:

I have this to say on my behavior:
I'm a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements, even when they are against my favor. I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do.

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face.

Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate.

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn't→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid. Almost (but not quite) as stupid as the species that create/embrace it. Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve.

Now, I have this to say about the """"good"""" people of wikipedia:
Wow.
There sure aren't a lot of you. I wonder why... You've seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits, you (think) you know what to expect. Well you have most of it down. But you went wrong at a few turns:
1. You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of.

2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.

3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that. 
And don't you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn't any diffen't with Bots. 

4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit:
You take leaders/favorites→ who take favorites→ who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don't knowwhat else to do. Sickening.

2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it's enlightenment.
Don't you get it?! He wasn't going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn't. He wanted to add insult to injury. 
You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to? NO! They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. 
We all want what we shouldn't have. 
Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have.

5. How you go about it is the wrong way. 
Some things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just """"stop"""". BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit, things will get much worse.

I'll let you know whether you care or not...:

When I saw your what your name was I almost laughed- not because it's Arab, which is fine, but because I could see the rest of the story coming. And sure enough- you have pictures of Malcolm X, former leader of the Nation of Islam, which is essentially the black KKK. What a fucking joke. Go cry about white; nothing in my last entry was untrue- the only thing that's even remotely questionable is my line about the majority of people in Ghettos dropping out of school and having teen pregnancy (but it is true). But why did you delete the segment about people getting scholarships to Harvard, or the fact that there are black politicians- are these bits original research? You and your black KKK buddies need to stop living in the fucking 1700s and wake up to the present- the whole world over is all about Meritocracy and Plutocracy, not race. Winners win, losers lose; the end.""",1

Sorry, I was going for a little humor in how I said it. Didn't mean to offend.  It would seem you've provided ample evidence for the city having poor air quality, which I think would merit a mention under the """"climate"""" section. 

I'm not so convinced for the singles scene. The most recent ranking, for example, ranks Pittsburgh the 24th best singles location.  Your """"17th worst"""" is out of the top 40.  Same deal with the other Forbes mentions.  

A city's ranking by Forbes as 24th best or 17th worst of anything hardly seems notable for an encyclopedia article. Forbes seems to do these rankings of various cities and towns quite frequently, and the more I look at them, the more I seem to think that most of them are quite biased, and mostly just """"feel good"""" listings for residents of the cities and towns featured. I think Pittsburgh did get a #1 ranking a few years ago in a Livability survey (can't remember where, but I don't think it was Forbes), and that might be worthy of a mention in an intro to the Culture section; but an entire section on """"Livability"""" seems like overkill to me,...   

Agreed. The livability of Pittsburgh doesn't need to be flogged so much.  Not to mention how much is uncited in that section.  

montage image in infobox
I've reverted recent additions to the infobox of montage image (collections of photos) because they were simply added and created by random users without any discussion whatsoever. The most recent montage added is actually rather poor quality:

For starters, these images are not very well separated  there needs to at least be lines between the images  the trolley at the bottom really blends in with the image of PNC park, which looks really bad. See the Washington, D.C. article for an example of how this is done.

The image of the Cathedral of Learning is horrible quality  very pixelated. As a matter of fact, most of these images are very grainy and pixelated, and shouldn't be used as an infobox image. Most of the images seem to be used later in the article as well  images in the infobox are better if they're more unique, and not used over again. There seem to be plenty of images to choose from though, and we could probably prune some of the images later in the article as well (some sections are very image-heavy).

The image of the astronomical observatory isn't even in Pittsburgh itself, but in the suburbs and surrounding areas, so it shouldn't be included in the montage anyways. The buildings and structures pictured in the infobox should be key buildings that define the city of Pittsburgh. I think we should stick with five images for a montage  start with a good image of the downtown area/skyline and put that in the middle. Then put two images above that and two images below it. The Cathedral of Learning seems to be a pretty big landmark, and certainly can be included; including CMU as well would seem to represent Pittsburgh's status as an educational city. Maybe put those two as the images at the bottom? For the other two images, maybe either Heinz Field or PNC Park (but not both, as too many sports pictures would be overkill; but we could put, for example, PNC Park in the infobox and then a picture of Heinz Field in the Sports section). For the last image, maybe either a picture of the incline, to connect with the city's industrial past, or a city of one of the bridges?

But overall, I think we need more discussion on this, because the two images that random users have added as a montage were very poor quality, and really were just randomly collected images from the ones submitted to the page so far. I will continue to revert any additions by anyone that adds a montage image without discussion or consensus.   

I agree that there are too many photos in that montage and the quality was lacking as was the separation of pictures.  However, the Allegheny Observatory is indeed in the City of Pittsburgh, located in Riverview Park on the North Side in the aptly-named Observatory Hill neighborhood.  Other than that, I agree with your choices for pictures, though I would make a pitch for a photo of landmark bridge(s) rather than of CMU whose main building is recognizable but not iconic in the way the Cathedral of Learning, the inclines, the bridges, or t",0

 Proposed wording on the """"generalities"""" of autoformatting 

Since the key members of the pro-autoformatting side—UC Bill and Locke Cole—have conceded that the results of the previous RfC on “son of autoformatting” would likely repeat itself if we conducted an ArbCom-sponsored RfC (∆ here), where Locke wrote , I am tempted to ask that you, Ryan, issue a declaratory judgement due to their default. I can’t help but suspect that they knew all along that the previous RfC was a fair measure of the true community consensus when Locke dragged us all to this ArbCom. However…

I instead propose that we do as Locke proposes: present autformatting to the community in a more generalized manner, not attached to any specific implementation such as UC Bill’s “son of autoformatting” as described above.

Here is what I would propose:

55050,"You got what had been coming to you. I hope that being a k3wL eleet nerd-o-pedia moderator has made your life hell.

- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

36129,"""
Actually, Nin Einne is right. I'll try to explain why. First thing: all scientific information (i.e. somewhat accurate info...) should be publically verifyable, where verifyable means that one can check whatever is claimed, and public refers to the fact that anyone can do that. Now, if you cite some source, like in the example above, it says """"blah blah near daily""""(citation number). Unlike what you might think, that does not mean that the sentence """"blah blah near daily"""" is a universally accepted fact  as proven by the fact that you have another opinion. What the phrase """"blah blah near daily""""(citation number) actually means is """"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah near daily"""", which, you'll agree, is fully correct. After all, that is what's written there and anyone can look at the source (because it's public) and read what is says (verifyable). Now, if you think that blah blah occured daily an not near daily, that is fine. But how should you go about it ? One thing you can not do: change the sentence and leave the citation! Because then it would mean: """"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah daily"""". That is not true! If you look at the source, you'll see it says """"blah blah near daily""""! Which is just what Nil Einne pointed out. Of course it can happen that what's written in the source is not accurate. But that doesn't mean you have the right to change it as you did.
What you can do is add another source that contradicts the first one. You could write It has been reported that """"blah blah near daily""""(citation number), but I think that """"blah blah daily"""". The moment you do this, however, you'll find that people will object, because what you have presented is not publically verifyable. So, what is needed here is a source, a pointer to publically verifyable information, to support your claim. The full list of newspapers would be ok, but very unpractical. If there is a single list somewhere, preferably produced by a fairly neutral source such as United Nation observers of something equivalent, that would be much easier.
You might think it's much more important to tell the truth accurately, even if you don't find a source, because, after all, the truth is what it's all about. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as the truth, a universally and unanimously accepted version of events, and certainly not in the Israelian-Palestian conflict. Imagine for a moment that everybody would put their version of the truth on the page, and what the page would then look like! So, we are bound by certain rules that allow us to govern information about events without spiraling into chaos, and these very rules that exist to create accurate information state that sticking to the rules is more important that providing accurate information. Strange as it may seem, it works: even when not perfectly accurate, the result will not stray to far from the truth, if there is any one such thing, and that result is usually a fairly useful document as opposed to a flamewar.""",0

You may use published sources that are not on-line. So long as they are reliable and ultimately verifiable by someone who would take the time to look them up to check the information.

Wikipedia has increased the need for Encyclopedic Value. Older articles that are not verifiable are being removed. The ones that have long standing clean up notices will either be rectified by interested parties or will ultimately be removed. Those notices serve to tell the public that the article does not meet the standards of reliability of an encyclopedic article. 

It appears that the Orchestra has been in existence for 50 plus years. It is not an emergency to get an article published. The heading ==Acclaim== jumps out as promotional. This is puffery and self aggrandizement. The article must be neutral in tone. The references or footnotes must back up statements in the article. for example use a statement such as - The orchestra has been well received by audiences in Country A and City B. Put in the references. the references themselves may be full of congratulatory language but avoid putting in the article. By way of illustration, if a news article from Country A said this is the greatest orchestra in the world and got a five minute standing ovation from the audience, you would use that as reference with regard to the aforementioned statement but would not put that directly in the article.

Will replace it soon  by a """"kosher"""" code. 

By the way - would you consider developing a QRpedia code with place for logo?
It will look better bearing the symbol of town, logo of museum etc. May be even the Wikipedia logo.

The initial criticism was that Stringer should be added as a source. It appears nobody follows this Talk page who has the expertise in anthropology (nor even the common sense) to comprehend that Stringer is an expert source who should be added to this article and it is now a badly-outdated article, as no valid challenges have been brought forth that would exclude Stringer's opinion from Wikipedia articles (and despite the very long period given to Wikipedians to challenge it), and thus:

I concur that this article should be unlocked, because, for example, see also my request for another year-old source to be updated, which is crucial as it is in the lede, and claiming that the RAO hypothesis is still the mainstream hypothesis in human evolution, when even those anthropologists who are cited as calling it the """"mainstream"""" hypothesis have retracted that claim and you are therefore basically misinforming a new generation of K-12 students, year-by-year, as you've kept this page outdated since 2010. It is obvious that no Wikipedians with expertise in anthropology have editing-rights to this locked article and are being responsible enough to maintain this article since approximately 2010, not even responsible enough to add simple {update} and {POV dispute} types of tags.

So, who locked this article? And why is it still locked for years when the person who locked it doesn't have either the due diligence and care, or else the expertise in anthropology, to maintain the page as being up-to-date within even three years, yet they took the responsibility for locking it and no """"elder Wikipedians"""" have addressed the issue? Where can """"elder Wikipedians"""" be found or contacted, to ask them to review the need to unlock this article and/or the abilities of the fool who locked it to not be allowed to lock articles then wander off and ignore, for years, perfectly valid requests ~~ """"valid"""" scientifically speaking, as well as regarding Wikipedia's standards for veracity of expert sources ~~ to update this horribly out-of-date article? 209.97.203.60  04:40, 27 January 2014""",0

 Symbolism of Benedictus Sextus Decimus resignation date announcement 

It should be noted that Joseph Ratzinger, ex-conscript in (Adolf) Hitler Youth, announced its resignation as Pope Benedict XVI on february 11th 2013, Benedict of Aniane and Adolf of Osnabrück feast day  Catholic online. February fest days: http://www.catholic.org/saints/f_day/feb.php. Maybe, this should be added in his biography.   
WP:SYNTH   
Close, but there's no conclusion. Not combining sources, just listing two. Just out of curiousity, NummerSechs, why should this be noted? Is there anything beyond it just being a sort of weird coincidence?  (talk) 02:22, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   
I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?  (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs

 Point by point 

(1) The current text has:
Take, for example, the rainbow of colours reflected from a puddle of water when a thin film of oil rests on its surface. That phenomenon can be understood by thinking of light as waves, the length of which results in different colours.A very clear explanation of interference in thin films may be found in Sears, op. cit., p. 203ff. Other phenomena, like the working of light meters in cameras, can be explained by thinking in terms of particles of light (called photons) colliding with the detection screen inside the meter, the force of which is registered mechanically by a pointer or needle.

This is just plain wrong.  The length of waves does not """"result in different colours."""" The different wavelengths of light are perceived as different colors.  And the fact that the waves of light have different lengths does not explain the """"rainbow of colours"""" either. If the editor had bothered to read Sears he would have an understanding that would allow a correct explanation, not an exercise in the mystification of the novice reader.  

Second, the description of the light meter suggests a device like the carnival strength meter in which a contestant strikes a lever using a sledge hammer and the other end of the lever hits a ball that then moves vertically alongside a measuring stick of some kind. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Even if the crude analogy of an electron as a bullet that strikes electrons and knocks them out of their original planetary orbits be accepted, the electrons do not then physically strike the end of a needle that then moves along a dial face. T

If this article is to be radically rewritten, it should be done so with both a clear understanding of what the true facts are and also with an eye to presenting those facts in a way that will not cause very damaging preconceptions to form in the mind of the novice reader.

It is the differences in phases between the light waves reflected by the air/oil surface vs. the phases in the light waves reflected by the oil/water interface that effectively """"cancels"""" light of some wavelengths and permits light of some wavelengths to reach the eye of the observer from each different region of thickness of the oil film.  You criticized the original diagram that clearly shows how interference occurs as """"off-putting."""" But what have you put in its place?

It is the (mechanical analogy) pressure of the dislodged electrons that moves them off of the surface of the metal plate and through a wire to an electromagnet that attracts the spring-balanced needle which then moves in a way proportional to the induced amperage. Then they go through another wire back to the """"low pressure"""" region of the metal plate. Even in modern light meters, it is all a matter of electrons moving in electrical circuits, not electrons pushing on lever arms.

Please be careful to give the most useful citations. I have discovered one citation that is a circular reference to a Wikipedia article by way of an external """"encyclopedia."""" Also, the expression """"Trojan wave packet"""" will not mean anything to the average well informed reader, hence serving only to create an air of mystery and incomprehensibility.  I have already supplied a reference that distinguishes Trojan wave packets from other wave packets.  """,0

Not everyone believes this crap, copied from AN/I
I do not know either John254 or Kristin Erikson and recently stumbled across this. But, I have to say this looks like a witch hunt with evidence that wouldn't even hold up as circumstantial. They can't prove they're not socks, so they must be. And any evidence to the contrary is more proof because it must have been deliberately planted. If we ban then and they drown, then they must have been innocent after all. Personally, I've been editing Wikipedia since the beginning (late 2001), both as an IP user and with an account that I have abandoned, so I fully understand KE appearing on Wikipedia knowing more than you think a new user """"""""should"""". I would bet that the vast majority (like 99%) of users spend some time editing as an IP user before they create an account  the only question is how long they spend that way. It looks like KE didn't bother creating an account until she found a need to do so. That not only is not wrong, it should be encouraged.
Like KE, I have also edited extensively as an IP. For the most part, I found no reason to create an account, but I created a new account recently with my real name and, of course, my new account appeared to be an expert about Wikipedia immediately. Like KE, I also dive deeply into things. Were you to accuse me of being John254's sock puppet, I would do the same that she did  dig into his edit history and compare it to mine to look for evidence to prove my innocence. Most of the contributors here have dug into KE's edit history and now may well know more about it than she does  are you therefore sock puppets too?
Suggesting that defending herself with evidence, against people who are accusing her with flimsy evidence, is ridiculous. And, to argue that she would have deliberately created arguments with herself and other contrary evidence, over a long period of time, just in case anybody ever complained is hard to believe.
At best, the evidence here looks like collusion, not sock puppetry, and I don't even see that. But, even so, there is no rule against collusion on Wikipedia. And we see it all the time, with people cooperating on edits. I personally have emailed people I know to suggest that they edit pages in which I had an interest. Doing so does not make them my sock puppet or vice versa, whether they agree with me or disagree with me. 
To me, this flimsy house of cards rush to judgment and assumption of guilt represents the very worst of Wikipedia, and I think that even if it turns out that they are witches (uh, sock puppets). And I, personally, do not believe it to be true after reading this and the information on KE's page.

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.

97616,"""This is completely absurd.  Maybe this is the case in the United States, however your northern neighbour makes no such claims.  The Philosophy of Chiropractic far exceeds a modality (manual/mechanical manipulation) and a lesion (vertebral subluxation/joint dyskinesis). It is about a holistic approach to health care using natural therapies primarily (joint manipulation, soft tissue manipulation exercise, nutritional counseling, medical acupuncturestress management, health promotion, ergonomic consulting, etc.  To insinuate that the existence of the profession depends on subluxations is a dated, narrowed view of Contemporary Chiropractic.

Also, anyone who knows a lick of neurology realizes that there neurophysiological effects of manipulation and, similarly, there are neurophysiological effects of joint dyskinesis/subluxation.   However, these are being taken in a neuromusculoskeletal context now as well as possible autonomic implications on visceral functions that may arise from chronic NMS pain syndromes.  This is a contemporary view of the profession.

The title DC or chiropractor certainly does not imply manipulation for subluxation.  Again, a narrowed view focus.  Rather we are holistic NMS doctors with an emphasis on manual therapies and other complementary therapies.  We;re not wannabe MDs or """"glorified PTs"""".  DCs trained in scientific schools are perfectly positioned to play a crucial role in managing and preventing NMS issues and PCP role.  
I would encourage you, Fyslee, to visit the CCA website or the new OCA one and you tell me that my sole purpose is to rid subluxations.  It is, at least in Canada, a dying faction as CMCC and UQTR embrance scientific chiropractic and not traditional/philosophical (straight) chiropractic.

www.chiropractic.on.ca

It is always important to have different perspectives on issues to remain objective.  I am not an evangelist (as a good analogy to the straights/subluxation based) and definitely have my criticisms with my profession, but it's mainly a generational thing.  The evidence-based Doctor of Chiropractic in 2008 is not tied down to the philosophy of subluxations (metaphysically) or at least in Canada (my POV which conflicts with your chiropractic POV which is US and not a world wide one.  

In fact, every DC since 2002 has been educated in the integrative EBM curriculum (CMCC is 45 minutes away from McMaster University, where evidence based medicine was born) Canada, unlike the US has NO subluxation based schools and they are both university degree granting institutions.  This is important because credits obtained at CMCC and UQTR can be TRANSFERRED to public universities unlike before.

In the end, Fyslee, you will begin to appreciate the sophistication of contemporary chiropractors.  Most of us have 4 year undergrad degrees in kinesiology of the life sciences and obtain various other treatment modalities (soft tissue such as ART/Graston/SASTM, get diplomas in Medical Acupuncture from McMaster University by the Department of Anaesthesia from MDs who designed the course from a anatomy/neurophysiological POV, obtained CSCS designations from the NSCA (http://www.nsca-cc.org/) etc.

 Regarding your email 
Go ahead.  32 
I've looked things over.  I don't see anything that requires a block or administrative action in any way.  This is a new user who is unfamiliar with Wikipedia's conflict of interest guidelines and needs to be gently directed that way.  Ask him to use the article talk page and discuss the matter cordially with him.  The sort of things you sent me go one many times every day on Wikipedia.  I could find a dozen or more conversations in the last 24 hours that look functionally identical to the one you sent me, and it isn't particularly unusual or out of the norm.  It's just someone who is unfamiliar with Wikipedia, and upset because they don't understand how Wikipedia works.  In the spirit of WP:DOLT we need something like WP:DOCOI: Don't Overlook Conflicts of Interest.  People with conflicts of interest may have valid concerns about article content, we shouldn't brush them off as though they don't have something valuable to add to the discussion.  We should instead try to work with them in alleviating their concerns, or at least educate them in Wikipedia's policies (keeping in mind they are an outsider).  Be gentle and clear.  That's my advice.  Also, direct him to express his concerns on-wiki rather than via email; discussions of article content should happen in the open.  32 

Wondering what you think
Hello TOJ. I agree with your removal of the multitude of run times in the Once Upon a Time in America. On the other hand I would ask you to consider including the European run time of 229 minutes. Various considerations include the fact that runtime is the one that premiered at Cannes also we include both the Cannes and US release dates in the infobox and we could label the two runtimes the same way. One other thing, while I can't remember the exact time frame but I know the 229m version did get showings in the US within a few months (maybe weeks) of the short versions release because, much like the two releases of Brazil, I held off going to the theater until I could see the longer version. If you disagree that is okay this was just a suggestion. If you want to move this discussion to the films talk page that is okay too. Cheers and have a good week.  | Talk

That is absolutely false.
You posted a """"civility warning"""" in my talk page.
That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  """,1

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.
 I'm sure the other states have similar legislation.   (Fuck you!) """,1

 Censorship 

Was Final Fantasy VII censored at all? I mean, the content wasn't as strong as, say, Final Fantasy VIII's, but I would imagine something was censored. Plus, it doesn't say anything about censorship on this page. Could someone please answer to this? 
Not that I recall. It certainly wasn't censored as much as the older games were.  
As I recall, some language was censored, some wasn't.  
The word """"bastard"""" appeared on various occasions, but """"fuck"""" and """"shit"""" were censored.  
< recet indent
Some words were censored, some were not, which ones seem arbitrary.
Only instance I could find of """"Fuck"""" uncensored:
Computer: Cid! We have an emergency situation! A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
Cid: What!? Who is the little fuck!?
Computer: I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Cid: Hey goddammit!! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there?
Earliest instance of """"Shit""""
Shinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either!
Tifa: Barret!!
Barret: #^*$!! You lucky #$#*!
Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now?
Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm…
In total, """"Fuck"""" is said uncensored once, """"Shit"""" is said uncensored 12 times, """"ass"""" is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), """"Damn"""" is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of """"Bastard"""".  Censored words appear approx. 33 times.  
My version must be different.  The """"fuck"""" is censored, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it """"shi't"""".  I noted a lot of uncensored """"ass"""" and """"shit"""" though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language.  In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profanity.  But yes, it was at least partially censored. 
 Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er 
Well, the box says it's rated teen for mild language and violence...  But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue.. 
Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia.  And even the slight mention is iffy to me.   
Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language.  But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time. 
It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.  

I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.

Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. """"Slightly stretched underwear"""" was changed to """"Therapeutic underwear."""" Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought """"slightly stretched"""" was sexually inappropriate. (The item is found in Tifa's dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence.)

During the epilogue that follows, the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later. While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinra's operations, it is now a land of lush greenery.

That was a mistake. A momentary lapse of reason. I'd somehow got it into my head that somehow, someway, just the slightest degree of sensibility would kick in. I'd forgotten that logic has no place here.

Clio basically told Dirk he doesn't know shit, and so I basically parrotted that back to her in order to try to point out to you guys once again for the zillionth time that you're letting her get away with murder.

And then came the ugliness. I'd forgotten about the whole thing until just now when I noticed in my contributions that I'd apparently made a remark on her page. Talk about a personal attack. I swear I've rarely seen such sickening thoughts put into words. And all about me. Such anger, such twisted hatred, such disturbed imagery...

No. I don't care how irritating this whole thing is. It's not worth it. This girl is not well, and NEITHER of us are helping. Haven't you noticed how many regulars have simply stopped editing out of frustration? Haven't you noticed how pretty much every question is answered by the same person? Do you not realize how responsibile you are for having actively participated in the transformation of the Humanities RefDesk from once being a vibrant place where one could find a multifaceted, multidimensional answer written by a variety of differing editors, each with his own invaluable unique insights and perspectives, into the stale, single-faceted unidimensional, useless place it is now?

No. It's not worth it. It's futile. Worse actually. Perhaps I share in some of the blame myself. If it wasn't for my relentless protestations, perhaps the whole thing would have blown over, Clio would have gotten bored of the Humanities RefDesk, moved on, and it wouldn't be the cold, sterile place it is now.

Perhaps I lost perspective, and didn't realize the magnitude of the harm that my persistent challenges could potentially inflict on a very fragile and terribly imbalanced young mind.

Just please read the damn thing over, Rockpocket. Here it is:  . Those rants of hers are clearly not the product of a healthy mind. I recognize that now. I have to stop. What I'm doing is wrong. So to all who will inevitably read this, I say publicly to Clio:

You win. I lose. You're right. I'm wrong. You're smart and you were right all along, I'm an intellectually impoverished imbecile. Yes, as you say, I'm pathetic.

26117,"There have been some recent edits that I wanted to discuss why I reverted.
First, I introduced a commonly accepted definition for the introduction lead by the American Planning Association and the McGill University School of Urban Planning. While there are many definitions out there, I suggest it is the most concise and easy for the average reader to understand. Urban Planning does not necessarily include the licensed (and historically separate) field of architecture. Urban Design can be described as a sub-field that was born of Urban Planning. Additionally, there are many subfields of urban planning including transportation planning, environmental planning, community development, infrastructure planning, natural resources planning etc etc etc. There are many subfields as listed in the Template:Urban Planning. 

The last cluster-f#@$ of an massive article resulted from a lot of competing perspectives of urban planning that led to it being 1. Too long 2. Unreferenced or original research content 3. POV 4. Weasel words 5. Some sections read like a personal essay. So for these reasons I have reverted the changes to the most recent stable version. Lets try to make this more concise and not turn into a crap article again.",0

First, this article does not talk about a """"class of dog"""" in the sense that a """"poodle"""" is a class of dog. It talks about a use of certain types of dogs. To chase """"quarry"""". This sets a context for these dogs (the matter of fact tone suggests approval of this use of a dog, as does, very much so, that the first requirement for a working dog is that someone should work it!). Describing what the dogs do as """"work"""" is strongly biased to a positive view of it. I do not strongly object to this, although it could be rephrased into a """"voice"""" that took things less for granted.

Second, many readers will not automatically realise that one is talking about dogs that could be used in fox hunting, yet this is primarily what they are used for at least in the UK. The article largely discusses terrier work in the UK, framing its history in terms of enclosure, which is not an issue in the States or elsewhere, because enclosure practices differed in other places. So the intro should note this, and having done so, making note in some detail why it is controversial (not just that it is) serves to balance out a piece that is far too sympathetic to one POV.

Third, the article on the Hunting Act is not specific on this issue, and it's appropriate to give it in some detail (if it is appropriate to go into as much detail about terrier work in the UK, which the article does). You should either slash the article to its generic elements and put the slashings into an article on Working terriers in the United Kingdom or accept that given the form of the discussion, a focus on UK responses is appropriate.

Yes, I agree wholeheartedly with that. I'm from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, myself. I've been in France and other European countries back in the disco era, and what we call """"disco"""" is encompassing much more than what is being made of it here. For instance, loads of really good disco music was made in Italy, Germany, France and even here in The Netherlands, because there was a lot of money in mafia to buy the early synthesizers. Moroder, for one, was an Italian living in Munich when the Donna Summer hits were created I believe. Disco to us here therefore also includes music by Gino Soccio, Cowley, Moroder himself (not only his Donna Summer work) plus many Italian producers. When I see this page, it's as if Europe didn't influence the genre, while it is the other way around in many ways. It wasn't Chicago or London where house-music started, even, the first fast-paced housey acidy music came from Italy, Germany and The Netherlands if you ask me. Take for example 'Remember' by Vivien Vee from 1977, and 'Crazy Family' by Jock Hattle, the long version from 1982. They both have long-lasting breaks in them, perfect examples of disco that would now be called """"house"""" or maybe even """"trance"""" for parts of them.""",0

Therefore they should be treated in the Algerian page as Tindouf is in Algeria.

If you do not accept this, then you have to drop the narrow focusing on the geogrpahic limits and start admitting that the crimes committed by polisario are done in relation to Western Sahara and therefore can be extended in this article.

 Joseph Szigeti 

Hi there! Would you mind taking a look at the Szigeti article and giving me some feedback? I put it up for peer review a few days ago and all it got was a review generated by a bot. The only comment that I found useful was that I can sometimes be too wordy, there are apparently still redundancies and peacock termsbut I can't see any of that stuff in my own writing right now, I need someone with fresh eyes to look at it. I'm hoping to put it up on WP:FAC as soon as possible but I also don't want to nominate it before it's ready. Thanks, talk 

Looks good; it's thorough and reads well.  As is my nature, rather than listing a lot of nit-picks, like they do at the Featured Article Pillory, Good Article Gauntlet and A-Class Inquisition, I uncapped my nit-picker and picked the few nits I found.  Optionally you could expand the """"reception"""" section; there's lots of commentary on  Szigeti's playing, and contrasts with his contemporaries  oh, you know, everyone from Kreisler to Heifetz to Nathan Milstein might be interesting  none of that is necessary, though, it's just something I might do if I were writing it.  I wondered about separating out the """"family life"""" section from the main biography, since you cover the """"bureaucratic entanglements"""" part twice, but in different levels of detail, but if you stitch that into the main part of the biography it could overwhelm it, so ... maybe fine as is.  Good article!   (talk) 

Oh, one other minor thing  I eradicated a lot of ghost hard returns, such as   I hope I didn't inadvertently bork your paragraphing, since the paragraph is together in the visible text but appears to be split in the edit window.  I assumed the lines were meant to be together.  (talk) 

Thanks for the nitpicking, it was exactly what I wanted you to do. ) I've had the same thoughts about the """"Reception"""" section, just not really the time to go paw through the stacks to find interesting little tidbits. Any ideas on what books would be most useful in that regard?
I meant to take out the now-redundant part about bureaucratic entanglements, must have just slipped my mind. Completely mortified that I got the poor man's date of death wrong this whole time, btw... talk

This isn't my field of expertise, but I noticed what seem to be some contradictory numbers or bad conversions in the Energy Content table. For example, Aviation Gasoline is shown as having a lower number of MJ/liter and BTU/gallon than Regular Gasoline, which doesn't sound right. But when converted to MJ/kg, the number is higher than gasoline.

I have another remark regarding the Energy content section. Is the displayed energy content the true energy content or the energy content when used in a conventional internal combustion engine (this would change the figurs greatly as eg gasoline is burnt here with 20% efficiency; while hydrogen is burnt with 40-60% efficiency)",0

This is false.  Graphic novels reach back to the Victorian era.  It's neither one of the first graphic novels, nor even one of the first modern era graphic novels, nor even one of he first super hero themed graphic novels.  I can think of no level on which that late 70s graphic novel is in any way a first for the field of graphic novels, aside from being a reltively early one (though not first) for Marvel comics as a publisher.

 I personally have noticed something at wikipedia and in the discussion, which I would rather call """"british historical revisionism"""". I'm sorry, but many Britons try to spin and squeeze facts and truthes. Additionally, they base their argumentation on statements like """"everyone knows German sources aren't reliable"""" etc. and just quote British sources in contrast. British sources have been proven to be wrong and propagandistic before, too - but somehow this doesn't matter to those """"unbiased"""" historians. Thus things like bombing German civilians, which was also described as crime by the British prime minister of that time and which can be called genocide if you refer to what """"Bomber Harris"""" said, is being justified like """"it is okay to kill civilians with bombs, but it is a war crime if you do so with a gun"""" by recent British revisionists historians.

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1

this article was the sum  of many peoples input , effort and hard work  so i dont know how or who removed it so thoughtlessly and put the meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page... any help would be great.... cheers..  

hi guys

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article.... let me ask....what was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anyway....you should have told me t get lost out of here...... what was the point of it all?  why did i listen to you ? at all?  why did i remove all personal references?  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail ?  why did i edit and re edit for style and content ?  why did i make additional references to religios , anthropological ,socialogical , philosophical ,medical , physics , chemistry , botany , mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected?  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort.  your actions are without integrity or honour ..... 

clairsentience article redirect ?

Hi ..... whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect ... can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period......
.........i could delete this clairvoyance article.... but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl......

..... i hope you can respect the clairsentience article...

..... ive been clairsentient for most of my adult life and it wasnt easy to come this far and to struggle for  decades to articulate my experience in a way which makes rational sense to the world at large of which the clairsentience article is a manifest example..... so please try and respect the vast amount of struggle and work which has gone into it....",0

 Suspected??? why doesn't he PROVE it... there are logs, history here... please check the ip user page and check what kinu DELETED. Also check that kinu banned me because he felt attacked (not a particularly good person to be the judge...). Even more and so we don't fall on the same discussion, don't continue with the discussion about the ownership of the talk page. It doesn't matter my opinion about that now because I was already banned for that (and i fullfilled that ban). I was NOW banned because I readded two lines that kinu had deleted to a user page... those lines weren't particularly offensive. Then kinu added that I created an account... COME ON!!! that was what everyone was asking for!!! (BTW, he added that account to a deletion page, but you can check it too from the ip mentioned).

So I'm banned (3 months) NOT BECAUSE OF THE DISCUSSION about the ownership of user pages (I was already banned for that), but for:
 - Undeleting something that kinu deleted without giving reasons. Note that we are NOT discussing the veracity of those statements (unless you think people should be banned for asking).
 - Later kinu added that i created a """"troll"""" or something like that account. How? I didn't have an account so how??? I used it to add the sentences mentioned (if your policy is don't delete unless offensive, then why was it deleted?). Furthermore, if you check the discussions you'll see that they where kept on my user page.
 - Finally, kinu added that I was abusing the unblock template... well, what could I do? kinu baned me and so went any posibility to appeal. Most admins don't read user pages unless you add that template... of course I'll accept that final ban agreed with WP policies; but I had no other choice (and it was a cheap way for kinu to silence me). I don't think I should be banned for this because kinu clearly showed being arbitrary... but if you think this later ban should stay, then think if it should stay for 3 months...

I'm sure someone will say that this is a sockpuppet account... I have no problems to continue this discussion on my initial userpage and having this one deleted... but I need to be able to edit it.
I ask any reviewer (ANY -admins or users) to check my changes AFTER my last ban and see for yourselves if what I'm saying is right or not... """,0

Formed in 1878, Everton were founder members of The Football League in 1888 and [avoid """"and's"""", very amateurish] won their first [avoid """"their"""", very amateurish] league championship three years later. [date of formation and winning not connected, should be in separate paras] Following five league titles and two FA Cups, Everton experienced a lull in the post-war period until a revival in the 1960s, winning two league championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their [avoid """"their"""", very amateurish] most recent period of success, with two league victories, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup—their first continental trophy. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.

The club's home colours have traditionally been blue and white, [Everton have played in many colours] and [avoid """"and's"""", very amateurish] numerous well-known footballers have donned the Everton shirt: the most notable is Dixie Dean, [use correct name, William Dean - he hated Dixie] who scored a record 60 league goals in the 1927–28 season. Since 2000, the club has annually recognised successful former players, nominating an """"Everton Giant"""" at the beginning of each season.

The club have a large fanbase and regularly attracts high attendances, averaging over 36,000, 90% of stadium capacity.[2] Everton have a notable rivalry with neighbours Liverpool F.C. and matches between the two sides are known as the Merseyside Derby. Liverpool F.C. were formed in 1892 by a breakaway group consisting of Everton's former president and several players. The dispute also resulted in Everton leaving Anfield, their original home ground. [Anfield was not Everton's original ground] They [avoid """"they"""", very amateurish] have been [avoid """"have been"""", very amateurish] based at their current home ground, Goodison Park, since 1892.

 stubbing the article 

I've stubbed this article (removed nearly all content) because the content completely fails to meet wikipedia's standards and needs a total rewrite. Among the issues are:
Copyright issues/plagiarism. Significant portions of the article are lifted from . See WP:CP. Examples include: """"Because participants were policed, punished, or rewarded by each other, a unique camaraderie exists towards the very individuals who inflicted the torment."""" """"Given the 20 years required for the memories to resurface, and the additional sequelae of PTSD, only a fraction are beginning to seek and receive successful treatment for their trauma.""""
The article is completely biased and presents only one side of the story. By searching through news articles I found that while there were many allegations of abuse, the program was also praised by significant figures including two US presidents. This is absent from the article. The organization and its treatment method is described completely from the point of view of the critics. See WP:OR
The use of sources is very bad. Instead of mainstream news or academic sources, there are references to """"Cannabis Culture"""" and to websites run by self-described survivors of the program. A great deal of information is completely unsourced. In certain cases - for instance the link to WCPO - the sources do not seem to actually say what the article indicates that they say.
Some very serious allegations are completely uncited. See WP:NPOV.
The extent to which this article violates wikipedia policy is shocking. This post, as well as other posts on the article's talk page lead me to believe that the article's editors have a clear conflict of interest and an agenda. That's not acceptable. This is an encyclopedia and articles need to be well-researched, well-sourced and fair. This is not a place to propagate grievances.   """,0

What a complete crock.  By calling everyone under the age of 18 a """"child"""", which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.  Teenagers are insulted to be called """"children,"""" and if you start using terms like """"teenage sex"""" and """"teenage sex with adults"""" to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better, the """"poor little abused children"""" angle is more difficult to sell.  Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme, and legally define everyone under 18 as a """"baby.""""  Then all sex with minors could be """"poor little babies being abused and raped,"""" which would no doubt please the Judith Reisman's, John Ashcroft's, and David Finkelhor's of the world.  When such semantic games have to be employed to sell an agenda, with disqualification of everyone holding a different perspective as """"perpetuating the abuse"""", what you have is pseudo-science and flim-flam, and not unbiased reporting. 20:10""",1

""""je te confirme que le cumul du développement de 1471 cavités rescencées sous le massif de la Pierre Saint Martin est bien de 437 km au 01/04/2015.

Les topographies anciennes ne figurent pas dans cette donnée (par exemple la Pierre et le Lonné Peyret). Les topographies de la multitude de petites cavités non plus. Il faut donc préciser que les 437 km sont le cumul du développement de toutes les cavités du massif de la PSM.

The Wikiproject No Ads, created as a backlash against the Answers.com deal, has served an important function in providing a space for users to express their disagreement with the Foundation proposal. While the current controversies about userboxes raise questions about political and social advocacy on Wikipedia, there should be greater flexibility regarding advocacy about Wikipedia in the Wikipedia namespace. Reported and linked by Slashdot and other press sources as a unique and spontaneous occurence in Wikipedia history, it has apparently had some impact as, despite being scheduled to begin in January, not a peep has been heard about the trial and proposed sponsored link since the deal's controversial announcement months ago. Currently, however, there is an attempt to delete the project or move it off Wikipedia altogether. Since the Foundation has provided no additional information and has not attempted to answer the specific questions that participants in the project raised, it is unclear if the Answers.com deal has been abandoned or simply delayed.

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your """"seen in the above insulting comments"""" which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say """"where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". Why do you think that """"Einstein, Landau and Feynman"""" are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned """"world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.

 If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier. 

 If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.

Can anyone doubt that Arab refusal to recognize the Jewish state was the cause of the Six-Day War?

Moreover, there was no """"occupation"""" before the Six-Day War. Yet the Arabs, led by Egypt, still called for """"throwing the Jews into the sea."""" So the question is why? why would they want to throw the Jews into the sea if there was no """"occupation."""" the reason stems from the fact that the source of the conflict has nothing to do with the so-called """"occupation"""" and everythingg to do the persistent Arab refusal to recognize a so-called """"foreign implant"""" or Western dhimmi presence in the """"plundered soil of Palestine."""" Therefore, this edit  is accurate and adds balance. In truth, I'd rather see the entire sentence that precededs it, The status of the Israeli-occupied territories and the concurrent refugee problem, are central concerns in the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict, raising issues in international law, and having far-reaching consequences in global affairs, removed per the concerns raised by Cptnono. Also, it constitutes WP:SYNTH. It is summary opinion that doesn't belong and it is not encyclopedic. So I propose that either my edit be allowed to remain or in the alternative, the entire aforementioned sentence be removed.  """,0

The opponent calling me hysterical did so when I had not posted anythiing at all so you should read the page again, what is written in capital letter was inserted long after the texts previous to it and after it had been written, so you can see that he is asking for my banishment for no reasons at all.
I have not being editing ANYTHING AT ALL on this site and you know that.
YBM has been editing all my writtings on it from the beginning also those of a user called Laurence but you never noticed it and do not blame him for that WHY? does he have the right to do it or are you just YBM himself?
I don't see why you are talking about people who cannot read french as all I read is written in english and the links you talk about show a webside with links in it to the same contain in english and in german. Things you will know if you had consulted them instead of attacking me.
You talk about yelling I am attackt for no reason and have to be subject to punishments which I do not deserve, and that you impose on me unjustified.
All the reason you evoce her do not exist.
I do not have edit anyone but my own texts.
I write in english
My links show a place written in 3 different languages.
Links shown by other also show french web site in french like fr. physic and there is links on the french site about the bogdanov affair who show web site in english, so what you are saying is rabbish, and od not constitute an excuse for expulsion but are low argumentation to show an excuse to through me out, exactly as YBM did.
The links i showed are not a web site about the bogdanov but about Voyer and YBM who act as a prove that the motives of YBM in that affair are not to conduct a scientific evaluation of the theory advanced by the Bogdanov, but a social experiment about manipulation of the masses and of evidences, as it is described in the web site which links are available in my column. Another link show what Voyer and YBM did to 2 other writers, a man ans a woman, previously to that affair, and show that he used of exactly the same tool as for this one, and that he stopped doing it when he begin to take care of the Bogdanovs affair. He is insulting the writters abondantly and even show the cover of their books with the title """"de la merde!"""" made in such a way to appear like if it was its real title.
I would like you to come forword with prove that I edited somebody text 'cause I dont see any.
As for your 2 texts above I do not see what is the problem with them so explain yourself.
What do you mean by threat? what kind of threat?
I do read on YBM column a threat to get me banished and a threat to get me ignored and a threat to deleete all my texts no matter what I write with links to wiki revert function, which is illegal by wikis rules, and a threat to get presented as a vandaliser of the site with a link to do it, even so I did not have written a word about it.
What do you mean I am not talking about the subject? Where?
I am firmly keeping the subject: there is no error what so ever in the Bogdanovs book and in their thesis, there is no attempt on their part at lying or at making a bluff out of science, there is people who pretend to be what they are not and pretend to detain evidences of something they barely understand, and who constantly insult the Bogdanovs and anyone who do not have the same opi8nion as they have, who insult the Bogdanovs famili, teachers, physical appearence, life, friends, constantly and in many forum of the internet.
This person is YBM and his associate are: Romnulphe, Voyer, rayon-z, and Max, and their name are to be followed every time YBM appear on a site about the subject.
There is plenty of links about it.
The Bogdanov have already discussed and rediscussed each and every point of the list of so called errors presented by those pseudo scientist, and have proven them wrong and other scientist have intervene too to explain how it had to be understood in theoretical physic, but yBm keep using them as if Igor had never argumented against it, and even do it in a way as if it was because he couldn't argue against it, even a fiew blog after he had got an all explaination about it.
It just doesn't make sens.
He always provocate people by personnal attacks and then reproach them to don't stick to the subject.
Thats a clear line in all his appearences on the net.
A specialist in theoritical science has once demonstrate to him how it hang together and explained each of the points he had listed, but even with that who was a perfect demonstration, he answered: I don't give a shit about it, and even if you prove me wrong on all points, I will continue anyway! he says that on fr. physic, and i put the link to it here and on the french wiki about the bogdanovs.

Did the world feel a little better, a little brighter to you? Did it satisfy you to belittle those who simply differ with you in their approach?

A tag has been placed on Paul center, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Sorry I never got to reply to to the message you left me on my talk page:

""""You can explain your comments all you want, but the fact remains that wikipedia policy dictates that we discuss articles, not users. Make sure you stick to that in the future. Additionally, adding the 'unsourced' tag to Iranian peoples is quite innapropriate. A simple look at the page shows at least 12 sources, not 0, as the tag implys.""""

Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him (with the exception of """"to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians"""", which, as I explained later in the same section, any person assuming good faith would take as an insult). You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one, personally pointing me out by name. I never did anything comparable to this. Is this in accordance with your policy of """"we discuss articles, not users""""???? 

As for the unsourced tag, it's been discussed in the talk page. The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article. All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups, but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page. The article is on Iranian peoples, so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are. Such a source has yet to be provided. 

I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages, but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings (Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group, that of """"Iranian peoples"""" - see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this). I'm not sure what's the best way to move on from here. The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind, but a lot of users are not being cooperative. I'd consider any advice or mediation. Thanks, Talk

 Problem with the Fundamentals Discussion - This Was Already Erased Please Investigate 

( minutes after posting this it was erased) check it out. this is very suspicious and unethical by the parties involved. senior management (if in existence) asked to investigate)

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President o",0

Ever thought about """"Soviet Jews"""" phenomenum?

Real Russian people were killed only as """"rivals"""", because of _war_ and not the _holocaust_!

P.S. For homosexuals killing, mentioned above - I would have killed them all if had a chance! Really, killing homosexuals is not a sin, according to Bible. AND, homosexuality was widely spread in 20'th century Germany, so i doubt they were really persecuted... Hitler stated himself that that were Jews', who dont'let Germany win the First War, and all other casaulties were mostly accidental... And, of course Soviets, who protected their counry agains the invaders were regular victims of WAR, not the HOLOCAUST itself.

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!

 1. SilentResident: """"Everyone knows that the 1st phase (July74) of the Turkish Army's intervention in Cyprus was apparently legal. None disputes that.""""
 AF: OK. Even there are many fanatics that do not see:
 The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) (29.07.1974, Resolution 573) """"The Turkish military intervention was the exercise of a RIGHT EMANATING FROM AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY and the FULLFILMENT OF A LEGAL and moral OBLIGATION.

 2. SilentResident: """"The 2nd invasion (August74) was an illegal......Greece, especially after the 2nd Invasion, deemed the entire operation Attila to be ILLEGAL.""""
 AF: Greece’s Athens Court of Appeals (21.03.1979; Case No: 2658/79): """"The Turkish military INTERVENTION in Cyprus, which was carried out in accordance with the Zurich and London Accords, was LEGAL. Turkey, as one of the Guarantor Powers, had the right lo fulfill her obligations. The real culprits . . . are the Greek officers who engineered and staged a coup and prepared the conditions for this INTERVENTION"""".
 Just after 5 years later than 1974, in 1979, Greece's Highest Court decided Turkish military intervention is legal without making any difference between 1st and 2nd military operation!

 3. SilentResident: """"The 2nd invasion didn't aim for the restoration of any law and order, because law and order in Cyprus has already been restored after the 1st invasion."""" 
 AF: The Rule of Law already ended in 1963 when NEUTRAL (German) (highest) judge of Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus (SCCC) was forced to go out of Cyprus by Greek Cypriots, and SCCC ceased.
 Since, according to RoC constitution, Cyprus can only be represented by the participation of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, and there were no Turkish Cypriot in RoC government since 1963, Parliamentary Assembly of European Council stopped representation of Cyprus in PACE and expelled all Greek Cypriot representators. There was no representation of RoC during 1965-1986!
 When you say """"law and order in Cyprus has already been restored after the 1st invasion"""", you refer to """"the law and order in Cyprus that was forcefully existed by Greek Cypriots via expelling Turkish Cypriots, and via administrating Cyprus as the sole representator since 1963"""". 
 """"The law and order in Cyprus that was forcefully existed by Greek Cypriots via expelling Turkish Cypriots, and via administrating Cyprus as the sole representator since 1963"""" was not the law and order in Cyprus according to RoC's 1960 constitution.  Hence, """"1960 RoC's law and order"""" was not in execution and in place after 1st Turkish military operation. Green Line that was drawn by Britishes in 1963 was not in its place and damaged in favor of Greek Cypriots even after the 1st Turkish military operation. Only in the Turkish 2nd military operation, Turkey reached to the original Green Line drawn by Britishes in 1963. 

 4. SilentResident: Turkey does not have the right to: 
a) permanently keep its military on the island's territory even without permission from the local Cypriot authorities, even after the operations were successful and peace was restored on the island,
 AF: a) Turkey had/has the right of permanently keep 600 soldiers in Cyprus forever according to RoC 1960 constitution!
 b) eviction of all Greek Cypriots, Armenians and Jews from their homes forever and settlement of Anatolian settlers to the island
 AF: b) Completely very big lie of Greek Cypriots:
 After the hostilities in 1974, population transfers were made in accordance with the population exchange agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots (Third Vienna Agreement) under the auspices of United Nations on 2 August 1975;United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 02.08.1975 United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 2 August 1975. the Orthodox Greek Cypriots in Rizokarpaso, Agios Andronikos and Agia Triada and Catholic Maronite Cypriots in Asomatos, Karpasia and Kormakitis agreed to live under Turkish Cypriot administration and stayed in the north and Turkish Cypriots in Limassol agreed to live under Greek Cypriot administration and stayed in the south of the Cyprus island.

(2) When the Contra program was transferred by Reagan to the NSC, Cannistraro was made director of Intelligence.
(3) While at the NSC, Cannistraro coordinated inter-agency meetings on aid for the Contras. [the second article].

“Director of NSC Intelligence from 1984 to 1987, [Vincent] Cannistraro went on to serve as chief of operations for the CIA's Counterterrorism Center...”  From the PBS interview:

Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~""",0

Generally English people are people who identify themselves as English and who are identified as English by others, whatever their ancestry.

12954,"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now.

You display your poor understanding of what science is and your childish attitude of tit for tat by finding arbitrary reference to back up whatever you say rather than scientific evidence.

And that's where you get into the whole WP:Crystal argument, which I can't even get an acceptable answer with on the help desk.  I am not going to have someone else's reality enforced upon me, on Wikipedia or anyplace else.  If that's a problem, have me blocked or banned and do it quickly!  The character of Daniel Bryan, the moment he declared intention, put that match on the card.  If that intention (see Kennedy-Edge) changes, WE CAN REMOVE IT LATER!  The only reason the WWE announced Rock-Cena, and you still need to source """"out of story"""" announcement in that regard, is because the character of The Rock and the character of John Cena stated the very same level of intention to face each other at Wrestlemania.  Or is it the fact that you (collectively) believe Daniel Bryan is scum and that the position of The Rock and Cena as legends gives them the right to impose that reality that Bryan has not and will never have earned?  And, as for the Triple Threat option  very correct  same thing, WE CAN CHANGE IT LATER WHEN IT HAPPENS.  Another option already proposed is that the Royal Rumble winner would face the WHC, and THEN Bryan cashes in.  But what level of intention breaks WP:Crystal?

I would be glad to, Noformation. A conflict of interest is defined as """"Where advancing outside interests is more important to an editor than advancing the aims of Wikipedia"""". The aims of Wikipedia is to produce a """"neutral, reliably sourced encyclopedia"""". My position is that editors from the rational-skeptic wikiproject and their ilk are NOT neutral in this subject, and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture, no specialist dedicated learning in it, have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it, and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature, and they are ill-equiped to provide a full, rounded, mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic.

Now, as for myself, I will tell it straight, I work 12~15 hours per week in acupuncture practice, earning $35 per hour. Acupuncture practice is not my main source of income, in fact my only purpose for practicing acupuncture is to deepen my understanding of the art and sharpen my skills in it. It requires 10,000 hours of purposeful practice to become a master of any discipline, and one day I aim to achieve mastery in this discipline.

I refute the suggestion that those people who are most qualified, have the most experience, have done the most study, and are most knowledgeable and passionate about this subject should be excluded from editing on the grounds of COI. In fact these are the ones whose input is most valuable, far more valuable than the input of ivory-tower rational skeptics who only bother to attempt to understand acupuncture through a theoretical, critical and dismissive point of view. In fact, considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page, which emulates the tone of those """"Quackwatch"""" websites that proliferate on the web these days, and considering their devoted following of Edzard Ernst and their elevation of his work as the number 1 source on the page (literally), and their transparent agenda of """"de-bunking"""" the """"pseudo-science"""" they consider acupuncture to be, it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are """" advancing outside interests"""" rather than being neutral, and thus they in breach of COI, as opposed to I.

All the points in your reply can easily be refuted. You said above: """"If text in one place is inappropriate or excessive . . .""""

Danny, how exactly is something that is 'critical' proof that it is biased or POV? You have failed totally to make even the most basic case for your assumed conclusions; you just jump there with one giant false leap. Criticism is not by default proof of a bias, POV, or non-objectivity as you incorrectly assume. For example, if you said """"five plus five is thirteen"""", someone could objectively and neutrally criticise your ability at maths, and your conclusion, and prove you wrong, without having any biased point of view, or dubious agenda. Facts can be proven false or true, that is the rational basis of objective reasoning. Merely being critical is not a valid cause for rejection of the one criticising, as you manipulatively try and twist into its meaning with more ad hominem. You also ignore the hypocrisy of your argument, as Jehovah's Witnesses have masses of material heavily criticising other religions, so by your default, it should all be rejected as POV, biased, and highly subjective, and of little of no value. You have shot yourself in the foot Danny. You then go on with paragraphs of irrelevant red herrings, straw men, and more ad hominem character assassinations, in true Watch Tower fashion. You should read these Watch Tower articles on criticism and open-mindedness. 

You come out with even more logical fallacies, by mentioning subjects that do not apply, and hoping the less knowledgeable reader will fall for your 'guilt by association' machinations. You speak about """"disaffected individuals, apostates, and anti-cult movements"""", as if this somehow applies to Franz, when you have proven nothing. I'm sure I could get a host of quotes telling us all how sick and degenerate paedophiles are, and link that to you, and plenty of people would fall for that one if said over and over enough times, and the trick would have worked, no one would listen to anything you have to say if they believed you were messing about with little children. Your corrupt use of negative propaganda is disgusting, especially as you claim to be a Christian. I suggest you read your religion's articles on propaganda, you might learn to be more objective and less scheming in your arguments.

You then say: """"Especially suspect are """"Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain"""" by publishing books, etc."""" LOL, I nearly fell on the floor with laughter with that one! Hey, Danny, look in the mirror! The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society makes nearly a '$$$Billion$$$ US Dollars a year, a large part coming from its massive literature sales, most to loyal JWs. They also dodge paying their taxes on that massive income, this depleting the local community of needed funds (except in France where they have to pay their taxes, and are calling on """"Satan's European governments"""" to fight Jehovah's scriptural worldly tax arrangements, LOL). The greed of the publishing Watch Tower is terrible, but interestingly not a peep of condemnation from Danny about those Watch Tower """"Especially suspect 'Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain' by publishing books"""". Pure gold from Danny Muse!

You then go on: """"There are not similar books listed on the WP pages for the Catholic religion. . ."""" Since when did JWs love to link themselves with Catholics? Besides Catholics being a specially hated religion by Jehovah's Witnesses, it is completely different in its size, history and doctrines, and its treatment if those who criticise it. There are over 1 billion Catholics, and a 1500 year old religion, with massive tradition etc., why on earth would it be described the same as a 120 year old cult like prophecy obsessed group that treats its internal critics like demon possessed monsters, and then expels them and bans its members from",0

There are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of Japan, marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per 27 October 2010, or 19 Dhu al-Qidah 1431, or 19 Heshavan 5771. Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.",0

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",1

51540,"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",1

 Edit request from Maksudfsa10, 9 March 2011 

Just a minor edit. I've added Azerbaijanis to the list that describes turks (in the first paragraph) as we are the second largest turkic ethnic group.

  

The Turks (or Turkics) are peoples residing in northern, central and western Asia, Mongolia, southern Siberia and northwestern China and parts of eastern Europe. They speak languages belonging to the Turkic language family.Turkic people, Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition, 2010 They share, to varying degrees, certain cultural traits and historical backgrounds. The term Turkic represents a broad ethno-linguistic group of people including existing societies such as the  Azerbaijanis, Chuvashes, Kazakhs, Tatars, Kyrgyzs, Turkish, Turkmen, Uyghur, Uzbeks, Bashkirs, Qashqai, Gagauzs, Yakuts, Crimean Karaites, Krymchaks, Karakalpaks, Karachays, Nogais and as well as past civilizations such as the  Kumans, Kipchaks, Avars, Turgeshs, Seljuks, Khazars, Ottomans, Mamluks, Timurids, and possibly the Xiongnu and Huns.""""Timur"""", The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001–05, Columbia University Press.Encyclopaedia Britannica article: Consolidation & expansion of the Indo-Timurids, Online Edition, 2007.""",0

Reply Remove Incorrect Libelous Comment By Media Lawyer 

a)Incorrect. Richie Ramone did not say such he would sue them for 20 years. That did not happen Source please?

b)Incorrect. Richie Ramone did not say he would """"sue and reap millions"""" There are no interviews with Richie Ramone about his lawsuit. Only statements from his lawyers.Sources please?

c)Incorrect. Most do not say Richie Ramone was """"embittered"""" that he left. Tommy left, CJ left, Dee Dee left. End Of The Century actually advances the case that it was an impossible situation to be in the Ramones. That is public record. Source please?

d) The band did not continue to be successful. Source please? The band was never financially successful, as far as album sales, and it got worse after Richie left. They were dropped by Sire Records that same year. The band deteriorated, due to Dee Dee's quitting in 1989. Most sourced information is that they were on a downhill slide from then. According to USA today, they sold most of their albums after Joey's death in 2001. To date, Ramones CDs with Somebody Put Something In My Drink have sold more than 1.3 million copies. Smash You was released as the title track to Loud Fast Ramones. 

e)Richie Ramone did not sue his """"dead band mates"""". He sued the Estate of Johnny Ramone as well as Ramones Productions. He did not sue the Estate of Joey Ramone, nor the Estate of Dee Dee Ramone, nor has he sued the wives and relatives of Joey Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. Source is the lawsuit. He did not sue Joey's brother Mickey Leigh, Dee Dee's wife Barbara, nor Joey's truly execptional mother Charlotte Lesher. 

First Media Lawyer says the band continued to be successful, and then it's that they have no money. Fact is, Ramones productions is a very lucrative business. Again, USA Today reported in 2002 that the band sold millions of units since Joey Ramone's death. That is according to Soundscan. Paper Magazine and others have reported on the big business of marketing Ramones since the sad passing of Joey Ramone. Media Lawyer's statement that the Ramones are in """"hardship"""" is not sourced. 

Request: Please remove what we believe is libelous incorrect TALK comment by Media Lawyer, unless Media Lawyer can produce reliable sources. At the very least, none of it is sourced.

Thank you.""",0

When diggers dug they have to organise the law and order themselves. Nearly every night robbers cut open tents and rob the diggers gold so, the diggers have to keep a pistol under their pillow. Diggers watched the people get punished and laugh at the robbers, one there's favourite punishments was putting on the robbers and then feathers on them. Diggers had to pay 30 shillings to dig gold.

Diggers usually found gold dust so they have to warm it up, so they kept it in a warm matchbox to melt it together. They kept guard dogs so they don't have to hide there gold. They would hand their gold to commissioner to keep it safe if they didn't have a guard dogs. Some kept there gold in a special bag and they kept wax on its opening to seal it, to transport the gold to major city to keep it safe from bush rangers.

BTW, the gripe here is that you did a near total reversion of everything I added, on the grounds that you felt the entire edit was POV biased, without even paying attention to what I added.  And at the start of this thread, I noted that AGI in particular was removed from this article and felt it was very reasonable to add that fact back in.  As for the """"Program Costs"""" subsection that I added, yes, it needed quite a bit more work.  But it is a legitimate criticism that has been raised in other forums and not just by myself.  If you had removed that one section alone, I wouldn't be so upset about what else has transpired.  I'm glad that you've """"added back"""" some of the content I put in, but I still am not completely pleased with the tone of the article and still feel a POV bias at the moment.  I will express further objections seperately.   

 Breaking up article 

I would like to propose that all of the information about People to People International specifically be moved to a completely seperate and independent article.  Clearly PPI is more than just the Student Ambassador Program, and as this article is written there seems to be a blending and melding of the two ideas and concepts.  This article ought to be about the program itself (clearly the """"flagship"""" program of PPI).  By doing this, I think it will help this article out as well by removing the contentious issue, the relationship between PPI and AGI, and allow this article to get on with the issue of simply describing the program and who is involved.  Information such as the awards that PPI have recieved are irrelevant to describing this program, as is invoking the name of Mother Teresa in a fallacious honor by association.

Tennis articles

Greetings Rich,

I'd just like to bring to your attention that, on some of the tennis articles, a certain user has been deleting the names of French (Roland Garros) champions, and changing the founding date of the championship. Even though outside sources, such as:

1. ESPN
2. Encylopedia Britannica
3. the Roland Garros website
4. the World Almanac

have supported the inclusion of all French Open winners to 1891, a single solitary user has been deleting the names of pre-1925 champions because it was """"not open to international competition""""but that's a lie. The very first winner, in 1891, was a British man, and two other British men made it to the final in the 1890s. 

Attempting to rewrite history with Wikipedia is what some people have done, rather than understand that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.

What do you think I should do next? User Fyunclick has refused to compromise or discuss the issue rationally. """,0

ikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",1

Next time one attempts to edit and supplies sources for statements by professional people only to be reverted with """"not a notable source"""" or """"we don't use primary sources to contradict secondary sources"""". If you attempt to complaint you get another editor giving you a ban on your talk page and telling you you violated one of the 4,567 WP rules. Sometimes you would attempt to expose or list some of the bias and how it doesn't appear to apply to these bully team members only to get banned again for WP:BLP. I didn't know article rules could apply  to editors personalities behing an imaginary tough edit name, disguise. Last time I attempted to disclose insults on my person and copied them to my talk page the nasty comments not only disappeared from mine and their pages, but the edit histories vanished, as well.  I didn't know this was an option and appears quite deceptive as the wikipedia system seems to keep logs indefinitely. Apparently not for the few dishonest members of the bully team. I laid a complaint against one of this bully team and all I got was WP:Boomerang threats and WP:Stale and WP:BLP warnings from the offending bully, I complained about. I feel I am still suffereing from that as I get regularly visited by one of the same bully team, who hacks up my user page until I complain and then I get banned for WP:BLP or WP:3RR because they coud detect I was thinking about reverting one more time. Another good one is """"lack of collaboration"""" on my own user talk page.  My conclusion is that this bully team exist to attack IP editors on a fear and predjudice basis. This seems to be the usual psychology, on the Internet in forums and real life, unfortunately. People fear the newbie and the unknown, attacking to rid themselves the unknown.  Most of the protection mechanisms are not available to IP editrs and are unknown. The more I educate myself on the ways of WP the more I realize they ren't not applied to IPs equally. I have been ridiculed so many times here I have toignore most of it, now. /rant off LOL 99.251.114.120

The 'Heyland factor', or it's unidentified equivalent, is how you derive transformer or motor from short-circuit and open-circuit measurements, which is a classical approach to doing it and which Leakage inductance article has been trying to describe incorrectly for several years. This stuff is proposed in Leakage inductance article, not in Transformer article proper. I am not proposing anything major in difference in Transformer article proper. Right now, everything about Leakage inductance is nonsense, so the alternative is to scrap Leakage inductance article. But there can be no doubt about the substance of the derivation per se. One may quibble with the presentation and the naming of this stuff but not with the substance. I will address these issues in proposed changes to Leakage inductance article. You are the one who suggested to start with ideal transformer and to first with linear (cum real) transformer. So back to the question: How do you fill the gaps between ideal and real?

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up.

 In my opinion, the three lists you just mentioned need improvement to reach the standards of the Oregon and Washington lists (that is completely independent of the fact that I promoted those two lists to FL statusthey simply contain more facts, stronger leads, more references, etc).  I think that a single table is more appropriate as it can be sorted and the order of sections seem somewhat arbitrary by making some symbols more important than others. Also, I believe it is crucial to separate official and unofficial symbols. I have no problem with having a table for the """"Unofficial symbols"""" sectionit just happens that the Oregon and Washington lists only have a couple so it was easier to construct prose than tables. I know nothing about Governors lists, but I believe some have been promoted to FL status so it is probably worth examining those.

Would it be possible to suggest that religion (according to Cicero, from Latin  re- """"again"""" + legere """"read"""") is a human survival strategy which allows those within to co-operate in securing their future - sometimes at the expense of their neighbors' survival. 

Hence th prohibition about killing and the 'just war' philosophy. It is significant that the scriptural (i.e. written) Judaic origin of the world and the garden of Eden is closely linked to the time and place (Ur was around Basra in modern Iraq) where writing was invented. The peripatetic Jewish nation  invaded Palestine (land of the Philistines) after, and their holy writings record much of this. 

Maybe as a westerner I am convinced by the Evolutionary psychology theory. Is this becoming a religion too? I agree however that Wikipedia should be neutral, and the King James is certainly not suitable here    08:41, 6 May""",0

158020,"""==Celtic Language?==

It says in the article that after St. Patrick was captured he began to learn """"the Celtic language.""""  It is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic (e.g. the Irish learned the Celtic style of art from communication with the European mainland, etc.).  So did they speak the Celt language? I defer to an expert on this one. 

To be more precise, what the article means is that he learned """"a Goidelic language"""" or """"the Old Irish language"""". Patrick would have already spoken a Brythonic language and some Latin. Depending on exactly where he came from in Britain, he might have known a Goidelic language as well. Celtic languages and Insular Celtic languages explain how Goidelic and Brythonic may have been related to each other and to other Celtic languages.   (Talk) 

Are you kidding?  Please identify your source in claiming that """"is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic.""""  Recent research has revealed that the Celts did not displace pre-celtic peoples but Celts did come to Ireland and the predominant culture remained celtic until English colonization.  Second, Gaeilge is a celtic language of the Q-celtic branch of the Celtic language family, thus the Irish of Patrick's day spoke a celtic language and it is assumed that Patrick learned said language.  Ergo, he learned a celtic language (though, as noted above, he probably already spoke a P-celtic brythonic language prior to his enslavement.

I have seen broken dates for specific invasions of the British Isles from mainland europe during the collapse of the Roman empire, these not only include Picts, Scots, Irish, Angles and Saxons and more bizzarely English! I will have to dig the book out with dates.  

St. Patrick: Fact and Fiction

I have removed 'was captured by Niall Noigiallach' as it is an obvious error. I will try to come back some time in the future and help with citation and new material.

What are the sources for the following statments?

1 - """"born Patricius Magonus Sucatus""""
2 - """" seems to have studied at the monastery of Lérins on the Côte d'Azur from 412 to 415 ...He spent the next 15 years at Auxerre were he became a disciple of Saint Germanus of Auxerre and was ordained possibly about 417.""""
3 - """"Saint Germanus consecrated Patrick bishop about 431, and sent him to Ireland to succeed Saint Palladius, the first bishop, who had died earlier that year. """"
4 - """"There was some contact with the pope. Patrick visited Rome in 442 and 444. """"
5 - """"Popular devotion to Patrick began in France, long before Sucat received the noble title of Patricius""""

These and other statments seriously mar what is otherwise a fairly good and reasonably well written article. Also the chronology implicit in them is all over the place. The fact of the matter is that no one know for sure what the dates of Patrick's life are; those of 461 (arriving in Ireland) and 491 (death) are estimates arrived at only after decades of discussion. Will whoever rewrote this article please show the basis for including these statments. Thank you. 

I've re-revised the article again in line with what I wrote above, for the simple reason that Pcassidy reverted back to his version again without citing sources for statments I take issue with. I dislike doing this unilaterally because it is against the spirit of wikipedia, but it seems I have to draw attention to this in some manner other than being polite. , 18:52 pm, 18th April 2005.

Hello Pete, glad to hear from you. The basic issues I have with the article as you wrote it - forgive me if I have mistaken you for another editor - are outlined above. I have no problem whatsoever with them being included in an article concerning Pat, so long as they are placed under some heading along the lines of """"Speculations about St. Patrick"""". Because we know so very little about Patrick I really feel it is vital to seperate facts, speculation and hagiography. And - I mean no offense - much of what I have outlined above falls under the latter two categorys. Thank you for your time. , 22:08",0

No, actually, we're not here for the same reason.  I don't have a lot of experience with Wikipedia, and I'm not here to do lots of work on Wikipedia, and I don't read their policies (would take too much time - not really interested - I'm an armchair reader/editor of Wikipedia).  What I find with Wikipedia these days, is, to find out some detail/meat on a subject, one has to go to the edits and look at stuff that has been deleted.  There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about.  I just got through going around in circles with a guy (I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator) where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter (a convicted Lucchese/Gambino mobster doing life for multiple murders).  The whole bio was taken from a well-known book called """"Murder Machine"""" and it was referenced at the bottom under """"References"""", but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didn't have a citation at the end of each sentence.  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book (and it's a good book, written by a well-known NY crime reporter).  What the guy/administrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit - that way, he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom.  I tried putting in a few links but I couldn't get them to work (somebody else fixed them).  It's really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys (they seem to be """"busybodies"""") as they delete and delete and delete, when in fact the items are either (1) well known to anybody that knows the subject matter (like Conrad's friendship with Spilotro), or (2) they are very easily found.  The way you are running things here at Wikipedia, the only entries will be made by administrators like yourself who know Wikipedia's syntax, etc.  You will either not get edits from people like me, or, if you do, they will be deleted.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

 Taean-guyok-gun (대안군/大安郡)

This looks weird. Each former county was formerly named 군. When merged wit Nampo, some were renamed 구역. The parenthetical Hangul names are the former names (why not, this can be an editorial choice). But the Roman names should be either all new or all former. We should have either Ryonggang-gun or Ryonggang-guyok (according to the actual name). And either Taean-guyok or Taean-gun. But what could be a guyok-gun ?",0

 Help sought! 

Hi there, been going through some rough phase of a wiki career. So a bit of guidance from you, on the following would be of help. I have a lingering doubt, and I wish to be clear before I resume editing in case to avoid further disputes. Is it acceptable to cite references of a different language into En.Wiki? (I find it hard to get them;the reliable references in English for some articles)

Also when can we have videos into an article? And does it matter from which site we take them from? For instance, I intended to add these youtube links as means of external links(directing to the respective speeches), but in the end I figure I had done something I had not supposed to. It would help if you could clarify regarding both. I find Referencing kind of not uniform across wikipedia, almost 70-80% of the BLPs are poorly sourced, but yet I find it amusing to get involved in such disputes.  (talk . contr . mail) """,0

  A 20 year monopoly on the American comic book industry is nothing to sneeze at.—yes, it is.  The focus of the article is on the comics medium, not on one tiny timespan of one tiny corner of the comics world.  The American comic book industry in the last twenty years is a tiny speck—in American comic books there's a whole long history that predates that, much of which is far more significant; the American comic strip industry has always been economically and historically larger; graphic novels have been taking over, and they've been growing outside the direct market and Diamond; and the American comics industry as a whole is dwarfed by those of Europe and Japan.  The Diamond monopoly is significant only to the American comic book industry of the last twenty years, and therefore merits mention in American comic book.

For quotes on the views of Chassidishe gedolim, such as Rav Halberstam, you use HaEdah or such chareidi newspapers.
For quotes on Zionist rabbis, you use Arutz Sheva or Makor Rishon or such newspapers.
There is no contradiction at all in using the Litvishe Yated for the views of Litvishe gedolim. There is a problem in using Arutz Sheva for the views of those rabbis who hate, detest, despise Zionism. Is that so difficult to understand?  | (talk)",0

Thanks! I just saw your latest efforts at Leon Jordan and went to email you, but see I needn't.

 Recap 

I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.

Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows: 

""""The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) """"

As for """"The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm..."""" 
In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are """"A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"""" and """"An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"""". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:

If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.

In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read """"The algorithm used for this purpose..."""" to """"One algorithm used for this purpose..."""" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)

Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be """"...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""""  

The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. 

As for """"...references not supporting the notability of the subject"""" 
You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like """"Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."""" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.

As for """"The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... 
This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better, similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots, but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line.

Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w",0

 Rindge article 

Hi DH,

Thanks for getting in touch about the population figure in the Rindge, New Hampshire article.  I did hesitate about restoring the info, because every edit you've done has been thoughtful and informative.  As I alluded to in the edit history, basically if you see a town in New Hampshire with a 2005 population estimate figure, it's because somebody first put in a figure and called it """"2005 Census"""".  Since there is no such thing, I consult the state Office of Energy and Planning web page, which conducts yearly population estimates, and retrieve the published figure for that town. (Concord and Peterborough are a few other places where I've had to do that.)  I can see the point of wanting to stick with just the decennial census figures, but I also see that there is a lot of pressure out there among readers to come up with more recent population figures  it may be boosterism, but it also may be caused by people concerned at how rapidly their community is growing.  Anyway, I've enjoyed watching your edits go in, and I look forward to seeing more!   """,0

 Any chance of a return to Good Article status? 

Talk:Harley-Davidson/GA1

When this review was done, the reasons for stripping this article of its """"Good Article"""" status were as follows:
Prose quality: Too many orphan sentences and single sentence paragraphs.
MoS compliance: Introduction is too short, see WP:LEAD for more info. Introduction should be a summary of the entire article, and generally should not contain information which is not contained within the body. One of the images contains a watermark for a website. 
Citation of reliable sources where necessary: Large areas of uncited information. Orphan sentences only complicate the issue of finding what comes from which source. Article is littered with tags and rough edits.
 No original research: Uncited information may contain original research.

Since that time, the introduction has been expanded, the offending watermark has been cropped out of the image (which had been donated under the appropriate licence by the site in question), and citations have been added, though maybe not enough.

The peer reviewer tool came up with the following concerns:
Consider adding more links to the article; per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links) and Wikipedia:Build the web, create links to relevant articles.
Per Wikipedia:What is a featured article?, Images should have concise captions.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (numbers), there should be a non-breaking space -   between a number and the unit of measurement. For example, instead of 45 cubic inch, use 45 cubic inch, which when you are editing the page, should look like: 45 cubic inch.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally do not start with articles ('the', 'a(n)'). For example, if there was a section called ==The Biography==, it should be changed to ==Biography==.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally should not repeat the title of the article. For example, if the article was Ferdinand Magellan, instead of using the heading ==Magellan's journey==, use ==Journey==.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), avoid using special characters (ex: &+{}[]) in headings.
Per WP:WIAFA, this article's table of contents (ToC) may be too long – consider shrinking it down by merging short sections or using a proper system of daughter pages as per Wikipedia:Summary style.
#The script has spotted the following contractions: Didn't, if these are outside of quotations, they should be expanded. (A search of the article found the use of """"didn't"""" in a quote of a reference.)

We should also keep an eye on WP:SIZERULE, which indicates that we should probably split this article.  Granted, the 91 kB size is a gross figure and the readable prose would be somewhat less, but splitting off and summarizing the History and Engines sections might be advisable.  

The Model Designations section could also use some work.

Also, the tag was put on articles that it clearly did not belong on, such as articles with relevant trivia in very small amounts, and pages that were explicitly labeled as trivia. WP:TRIV says to be cautionary with trivia, not to remove it entirely. And if you interpret it otherwise, that is an issue to debate. The anon disrupted WP to possibly prove the point that trivia does not belong in wp, which is explicitly forbidden. Now, I did not judge him solely because he was anon, but because of the massive amounts of editing done by an anon in a short period of time, without any variation whatsoever. No, being anon is not enough to condemn him. Neither is a specific edit to a lot of pages. It is the fact that he is anon, AN?D doing a massive amount of edits AND said edits are not fully constructive. The toomuchtrivia tag is only to be used when trivia is so numerous as to unbalance an article. Some of the pages, like the Bullshit! article had very little trivia, and the trivia it had was rather constructive. Also, there were some pages explicitly labeled as trivia pages that got the tag.

Stephan, may I borrow this comment and sprinkle it on my lawn to help it grow? Really. I have watched this topic area for years and BLPs of skeptics are absolutely littered with opinions like this. Do some research on skeptic BLPs and notice how much George Monbiot is quoted, and he's not even a scientist!. Editors like you have either ignored the use of such opinions as sources or outright endorsed it, because the opinions supported your POV. Now we have similar opinions from a respected climatologist, published in the Wall Street Journal, and all of a sudden it's a primary source?! Please! Anyone who spends more than 5 minutes examining the histories can see the blatant hypocrisy of your position. In fact, on BLP/N right now there is a debate about Michaels' criticism started by none other than ChrisO  this is the same editor who has, in the last week, edit-warred to include non-notable and weakly-sourced criticism in Chris Monckton's BLP. The hypocrisy of the editors here is absolutely astounding, and I will be shocked if arbcom doesn't deal with it.   20:26",0

 Please do not attack other editors. If you continue, you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia.    
I know you're just going to delete this, Jasen, but deleting warnings is considered acknowledgement of them. My offer of help with use of English spelling and grammar still stands and I hope in the future you'll respond constructively about criticism of your edits rather than taking the racist low road.   
I've warned you before about leaving me messages. FYI, I always keep my talk page blank, as do many other users. If you want to see the witty messages you left me in my talk history, feel free to persue it and stay as long as you want to.... That said, your opinion is neither welcome nor the least bid valid.  From this point on, mind your own business, and save the """"smart-alecy sincere with the demeaning undertone"""" reply I know you are thinking up, since I'll delete it before I read it, per usual. Have a really, really great life.   (KA-BOOOOM!!!!) 
Again, telling me to mind my own business illustrates that you don't quite grasp that Wikipedia is a collaborative project; it's everybody's business. I was initially concerned with your consistent spelling and grammar mistakes, and writing style/tone problems, but I stopped because you don't seem to care and I'm not going to follow you around and clean up your messes. Maybe they can create a bot to do that. But when you went a step further and completely misinterpreted a source, twice, I felt I had to say something, and then you went with your race-baiting bullshit and personal attacks. That might be fine for call-ins to sportstalk-radio, but it doesn't belong here. You've been warned by an admin, so keep that in mind. I suggest you concentrate on contributing to the project in a constructive and encyclopedic manner.

 that's exactly it, i think.  it's a paradigm difference.  some people see creationism as morally and factually wrong because of their PARADIGM, and others see it as morally and factually right because of THEIR paradigm.  and they're throwing falsifiability and bias and everything else at each other ... but when it comes down to it, it's a PARADIGM difference.  At the same time, however, one, the other, or something else IS factually true.  And so what SCIENCE needs to do is keep as BROAD a paradigm as possible in allowing itself to go through the process of falsification.  A scientific community that ASSUMES Genesis is true will be limited in its ability to falsify itself ... because it will always say, """"well ... we just haven't figuredn out how to justify that assumption yet  but we will!""""  Similarly, a scientific community that ASSUMES God does not exist will say the same thing.  I think what science needs to do is take a position of NEUTRALITY regarding the hypotheses of a creator  and allow falsification to take its course.

 where this leads me is this.  the falsifiable assertions of evolution are: """"Evolution is false where there are clear and distinct boundaries between """"kinds,"""" across which macroevolution cannot occur"""" and """"evolution is false where life, by its very nature, can never arise from non-life.""""  In my opinion, IF the theory is falsified in that way, ID becomes the """"improved theory""""  because it takes ALL the contemporary evidence that is explained by evolution, AND explains abiogenesis and macroevolution  making it that new path integral formulation to F=ma.

However, ID requires the PARADIGM shift that there IS a creator.

You said: """"perhaps you don't understand. This does *not* belong here. Stop readding it. If people want to read this garbage , they can go to the reference you have linked"""". 
It's an English translation. The reference links to a Russian text. Clear to you? Say """"stop"""" to your partner in gay plays.

Well, he's an idiot, he's divisive (just see Wikipedia:Requests for comment/TyrusThomas4lyf), and he's unapologetic, so I'd just as soon have the permanent block enforced.  But I'm getting tired of being the de facto policeman regarding him, so if no one else wants to step up then I guess you'll be seeing more of him. —   22:50, 1 March",1

137397,"""Pirizcki, you know we both and other users, like the IP address who put LedRush in his place, want to eliminate the 300 million figure. I found the current consensus a small improvement on the article. Posting an estimation, however, does not necessarily mean that the two numbers should be in perfect balance. I made the suggestion to name Atlantic Records with the 200 million figure, e.g. """"according to Atlantic Records, the official worldwide sales of..."""", while the 300 million figure can be left as it is, with """"while other sources."""" The current status of the article leaves readers and journalists to choose between the two figures uninhibited, but disrupting the balance between the figures could work as an indication towards the more accurate number, and it's not inaccurate to name Atlantic Records at all, it's to the contrary very appropriate.

As a Conservative I think we need to LIONIZE Senator Kerry   
-    
- I think we need to add a section APPLAUDING Kerry's DENIGRATING AND INSULTING cheap shot insults directed at our brave soldiers in Iraq.   
-    
- After all, Senator Kerry just insured that conservatives will maintain control of both the House AND Sentate this year with his DESPICABLE comments.   
-    
- My DEEPEST condolences to Kerry apologists and liberal editors at Wikipedia (in other words, AT LEAST 90% of you.)   
-    
- In 2004, the dems and their LIBERAL enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Viet Nam, figuring it gave Kerry an edge. So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth, it was! LOL! (With additional props to Dan Rather.)   
-    
- In 2006, the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge.   
-    
- And thanks to Senator John Kerry, the Dan Rather of 2006, this year's election is about Iraq.    
-    
- Except not quite the way they intended. LOL!!!   
-    
-    
-    
- And no, saying it was 'joke' just won't cut it.    
-    
- This latest Kerry outrage totally fits the LONGSTANDING pattern of Dems hating and denigrating our troops. From Kerry's GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich, to Howard Dean to a San Francisco (where Nancy Pelosi is from) supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military, the antipathy is indelible.   
-    
- And saying, 'Hey! I wasn't trying to insult our troops, just our Commander in Chief!'   
- only makes it worse. The American Legion certainly isn't buying it.   
-    
-    
- Perhaps you liberal wikipedia editors want to attack them too!   
-    
- Senator John Kerry - You can't blame the Swift Boat Vets this time!",1
